Guess what they call someone who asks women to cover up if they don't want to attract creeps and predators? A victim blamer.

People who are white knighting about this obviously haven't stepped into a gym for awhile and are really just upset over marketing material that made them feel bad about themselves. And instead of doing something about their perceived insecurities/inadequacies, went looking for some made up moral high ground and started screaming for attention. 

Someone could see the video and go ""mmmm maybe I really should start working out"" and instead of seeing the good that could come with that, we decide its better to focus on the creeps and predators whom are already in the gyms if they were so inclined to pursue their ""passions"" to begin with.

> SINGAPORE: A suspected Omicron cluster has been detected at an Anytime Fitness outlet located in Bukit Timah Shopping Centre, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Dec 21).

> Three COVID-19 cases have been linked to the gym, of whom two have tested ""preliminarily positive"" for the Omicron variant. The result for the remaining case is pending.

> None of the cases has recent travel history. In its press release issued shortly after midnight, MOH said epidemiological investigations found that the three cases visited Anytime Fitness at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre between Dec 15 and Dec 17.

> All three cases are fully vaccinated and have mild symptoms. The cases are also being ringfenced through contact tracing, added MOH.

> The first case, identified as Case 280856, is a 24-year-old man who is unemployed. He developed a sore throat and fever on Dec 18 and sought medical attention at a general practitioner (GP) clinic where he underwent a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

> His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day.

> The second case is an 18-year-old student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The woman, known as Case 280951, was last in school on Dec 15. She developed a sore throat and fever on Dec 18 and also sought medical attention at a GP clinic where she was tested for COVID-19.

> Her PCR test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on Dec 19.

> The remaining case is a 21-year-old student at At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy but had not been to school recently. Known as Case 280990, the man developed a sore throat on Dec 18 and sought medical attention at a GP clinic where he was tested for COVID-19. His result came back positive on Dec 19.

> MOH said staff members and visitors of Anytime Fitness at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre who are identified to be close contacts of the cases will be placed on quarantine.

> As a precautionary measure, other visitors to the gym between Dec 15 and Dec 17 will be issued health risk warnings (HRW). They will also be contacted by MOH for a one-time targeted PCR test.

> ""All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell,"" said MOH.

> The Health Ministry added that to date, there are 71 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Singapore, with 65 imported cases and six local cases.

> ""Given its high transmissibility and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more Omicron cases at our borders and also within our community. It is important for everyone to continue to play their part and remain vigilant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to come forward to receive your vaccination or booster dose when offered,"" it added.

In Johannesburg, cases have already peaked around 2 weeks before today despite the variant being discovered less than one month ago. Other cities in South Africa like Cape Town and Durban are seeing cases peak in the last few days since the variant hit them later on. We should look closely at London and NYC over the next 2 weeks to see if this trend is repeated in other cities and countries; these places got hit with Omicron 1-2 weeks after SA first reported the variant and are seeing widespread community transmission today.

In the context of Singapore, we would probably see a wave similar to Delta a couple of months back. Omicron is certainly more infectious and likely has a higher risk of vaccine breakthrough, even among those with 2 doses. However, the big piece of good news from SA is that the variant is much milder when compared to their Delta wave. There were 92 deaths last week in Johannesburg, a fraction of the 400-500 weekly in the initial stages of their Delta wave and less than 10% of their peak mortality. Furthermore, their population is only around 30% fully vaccinated, well under the 86% in Singapore. Doctors there also report a significant drop in recovery time, from 8.5 days with Delta to just 2.8 days with Omicron. If such a trend is repeated in Singapore, we will see a short sharp spike in cases but a much flatter hump in ICU admissions and deaths.

There is one other trend which could be worrying when looking at other developed nations. Unlike Delta, there seems to be almost no time lag between case detection and hospitalization. In London and NYC, hospital admissions have been ticking up immediately from early December, possibly due to the shorter incubation period of the variant. This means that we must anticipate this wave and prepare our healthcare infrastructure accordingly. Policy adjustments take days or weeks to have an effect and considering the high intensity and short duration of the coming wave, the variant would have saturated our population naturally before any reactive measures can affect it.

1.) Jo'burg has seen a spike that's now coming down - that's in a population with 24% vaccinated (and an unknown number that have prior infections)

2.) We have just gone through the wave with Delta - so we have the immunity already from recent infection waves, inoculation and boosting - way more protection than 24%

3.) We have just seen the ICU empty - however the beds are there and can be ramped back online if we need it

4.) The hospitalisation duration in SA has dropped from ~8 days (delta) to ~2 days (Omicron)

5.) The UK is not seeing a huge surge in hospitalisations even though their cases are off the radar

So, we could plod along with the miserable pace of ""reopening"" or we could get it over and done with more quickly. I am yet to see whether flattening the curve results in fewer total infections - i.e. is the area under a flat curve smaller than one under a peaked curve?

Indeed, they indicate as much as 4x undercounting of COVID deaths per week during their Delta wave in July. There is certainly some degree of undercounting of cases and deaths today too. Therefore, instead of comparing SA to other countries, let's compare it to its own past waves to the Alpha and Delta variants.

According to the source, we see 15k excess deaths per week nationwide in Jan 2021 and 10k per week in July. This has since dropped to around 1k per week in October before Omicron was found. The most recent data point available is the week of 5-11 Dec with 1887 excess deaths. In comparison, they reported 3000-4000 excess deaths per week in June, 1 month after their Delta wave started, and around 5000 excess deaths per week in December 2020, 1 month after Alpha started spreading there. Zooming in to Gauteng province, the epicenter of Omicron which also houses Johannesburg, they report 280 excess deaths that week. This is only a mild increase over the ~100 weekly in October and well under the 1000-2000 weekly in June 2021.

As you said, it's definitely still too early to make conclusive statements, but the data is pointing towards the variant being milder than Delta or Alpha. It will be interesting to see how these trends play out over December, and like I said in the original comment, we should see whether it is repeated overseas. Developed countries like the UK and US will have much more accurate case, hospitalization, and death data, and if/when the cases peak before year end, we should have clearer evidence on Omicron's severity by comparing their hospital admissions.",7,0.9011,Positive

The Health Minister has said that everyone either has been infected or is vaccinated or both at the time when Omicron hit. 

2) Whereas Singapore's Delta wave only hit \~5% of the population, so our Delta wave doesn't really matter. Maybe we still have a higher percentage of totally Covid-naïve people (never infected and never vaccinated) as compared to SA. 

3) ICU is about 50% empty. Omicron sounds A LOT more infectious, so maybe letting it rip will hit case numbers of 20k or even higher. I really can't say if the lower severity of Omicron (if true) will balance out the higher case numbers. 

4) In SA, 8 days hospitalisation for Delta vs 2 days for Omicron is really a comparison of 8 days for first infection vs 2 days for re-infection. We can't tell from SA data what Omicron hospitalisation is like for first-timers.

5) We're currently buying time to see what the hospitalisations in UK are going to be like, since they actually have old people unlike SA. The UK surge really started on 15 Dec, so it's too early for hospitalisations to show up. If the Omicron cases in UK/Europe really aren't hospitalising/killing old people, then we can relax and let 'er rip here.

Essentially we don't have enough data yet to determine how many cases per day would start to overload the hospitals here. Another crucial factor is that our healthcare staff will also get Omicron outside of the hospitals, and them being unable to work for 10 days can start to become a major issue, plus close contacts being asked to stay home. 

""Flattening the curve"" usually does not assume that the area under the curve will be smaller.

The problem is that:

1.) There's a 2 day window between getting the test and boarding the plane - plenty of time to catch Covid and bring it with you on holiday

2.) There's a lag between being infected and being PCR+ - i.e. if I caught it in the queue for my PCR test then that PCR test probably won't have the chance to catch it

... what we don't know is how many people test PCR+ and are not allowed on planes as a result. All we see is the failures, not the successes. It's impossible to tell if they're making a difference or not, but I suspect they are blocking some people from boarding that could infect the whole plane.

The argument for dropping them is one of ""do we want to go full endemic or not"". I would be happy to see them dropped, just let the virus run its course. However your complaint seems to be that we're getting infections from overseas, so I doubt you'd want to remove testing altogether.

> SINGAPORE: A compliance officer with an investment management company recorded videos of men in the shower at Anytime Fitness gym because he felt ugly and wanted to know what other men looked like.

> Von Ling Wei Hao, 36, was sentenced to 20 weeks' jail on Friday (Dec 16).

> Ling pleaded guilty in November to eight charges including voyeurism and creating obscene films, with another five charges taken into consideration.

> The judge called for a mandatory suitability report for him, but he was found unsuitable for the order. Citing the report, the prosecutor said Ling does not suffer from any diagnosable condition.

> Ling was caught in January 2020, when he went with a colleague to exercise at Anytime Fitness in International Plaza.

> After about half an hour, he went to shower in the men's changing room and noticed that someone else was showering in a cubicle.

> Ling showered in the next cubicle, but decided to film the other person that was showering. He held his phone above the partition and filmed the man showering.

> However, the victim noticed the phone and realised he was being filmed. He felt uncomfortable, stopped showering and knocked on Ling's cubicle door.

> Ling did not respond, so the victim went to inform an employee of the gym and returned to the changing room with a few staff members.

> When they knocked on the door, Ling, who was in a panic, said he was changing and tried to stall for time. Eventually, he came out and denied the allegations.

> However, he later passed his phone to an employee of the gym, who called the police. When the police confronted him, he admitted to filming the victim.

> After Ling was arrested, he admitted that the incident was not his first time recording other men in the shower. He said he had done so for more than a year and would watch the videos afterwards.

> He claimed that he did so ""out of a sense of inferiority"", as he thought he looked ugly and was therefore curious about what other men's bodies looked like.

> Ling further explained that he did so because he thought his body looked terrible and he wanted to look like other people.

> His phone was found to contain multiple videos of men showering at Anytime Fitness.

> VOYEURISM CONTINUES TO BE ON UPWARD TREND

> The prosecutor sought 20 weeks' jail for Ling, saying voyeurism continues to be on the upward trend.

> He said the offences captured the victims fully in the nude and went on for more than a year.

> Ling's lawyer, Mr Kalaithasan Karuppaya, asked for leniency for his client. He said Ling is remorseful and does not wish to come back to court.

> He added Ling has ""attempted self-help for his stress"" and has ""gone into fellowship programmes"" and is involved in charity work.

> ""In summary, he wishes to put this episode behind and start afresh. He's extremely worried for his career,"" said the lawyer.

> Ling requested to address the judge directly and said: ""I'm very sorry and remorseful for what I've done. To all the victims and everyone involved. I promise to be a good standing citizen in the future. Please kindly give me a chance to contribute to society.""

> District Judge Wong Li Tein said the offences were hard to detect and in fact did go undetected for some time until he was apprehended due to the vigilance of the victim in the January 2020 incident.

> Ling did not suffer from any psychological impairment, and was a functioning individual able to work and visit the gym, she said.

> However, she took into account his plea of guilt and the fact that he was a first offender.

GUEST OR TRESPASSER?

While terms and conditions restricting gym members from bringing in guests are legally enforceable in general, the question is whether someone is a guest or an unwelcome trespasser, said Mr Jonathan Tan, senior legal associate of Wither KhattarWong’s dispute resolution team.

If the person has trespassed or is a tailgater unknown to the member, it is difficult to agree that members should have a legal obligation to prevent such people from entering the gym premises, Mr Tan added.

“This is tantamount to expecting gym members to be a security guard for the gym. We also have to consider the safety risk to gym members if they are expected to confront the trespasser or tailgater.”

Mr Mark Teng, executive director of That.Legal LLC, said such contractual terms “should not be drafted just to protect one party” or it will become “a recipe for unhappiness down the road”.

He noted that this will happen when – rather than if – the other party finds out they agreed to something they felt was not right.

Mr Nicolas Tang, managing director of Farallon Law, said the legal enforceability of such terms and conditions also depends on whether they are in the membership contract, or are merely imposed on members after they join the club.

Alan was referred to Anytime Fitness’ membership policies when he disputed his tailgating fee. These terms would not be enforceable against him if he did not sign the policies or they did not form part of the membership contract, Mr Tang added.

NOT MEMBERS' RESPONSIBILITY TO DETER TAILGATING

All three lawyers agreed that under the gym chain’s terms and conditions, it can only justly impose a tailgating fee if Alan intentionally allowed someone to enter using his key fob.

Mr Teng said it appeared that the gym member could legitimately argue that he neither brought the tailgater in nor allowed anyone else to use his key.

“Nowhere in the terms does it say in so many words that it is Alan’s responsibility to ensure that no other person should be permitted to tailgate him. If these terms were provided for, then a ‘tailgating fee’ might then have been justified,” Mr Teng pointed out.

“Perhaps, from a customer relations standpoint, it would have been better if Anytime Fitness had sought Alan’s input first before imposing the ‘tailgating fee’ blindly.

“From a legal agreement drafting perspective, Anytime Fitness could have been more customer-centric with its policies,"" Mr Teng added.

Mr Tan said the tailgating fee imposed by Anytime Fitness is unlikely to be legally enforceable if it was not stipulated in any relevant contractual documents. Penalty clauses in contracts – which are clauses that disproportionately punish a breach of contract – are generally not enforceable in Singapore either.

He noted that if a court had to rule on this issue, it likely has to consider some factors like whether the relevant terms of the contract are unfair to the gym member – including whether the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 applies.

This legislation primarily protects consumers who may suffer prejudice by virtue of their weaker bargaining positions.

A court would also consider whether the gym has a duty or obligation to protect the security or integrity of its premises, like installing a turnstile at the entrance.

""If a gym wants to take a harsh position in relation to trespassers or tailgaters, and yet decides to adopt a certain business model (such as being open 24 hours without any attendants), then it might be reasonable to expect that the gym should take certain precautions to safeguard its own interests and the security of the gym premises and gym members,"" Mr Tan added.

Another factor for a court to consider is whether such terms have been specifically agreed by or highlighted to the customer or member, Mr Tan said.

He raised the legal principle called the “red hand rule”, which states that an unfair or onerous clause must be brought fairly and reasonably to the attention of the other party before it can be enforced – for example, with a hand symbol printed in red ink pointing to an onerous term.

I know of so many people who spent hundreds/thousands signing up for gym packages, letting it go to waste, and not being able to get out of it since they're locked into the plan.

I'd recommend giving ActiveSG a shot. Firstly, cardio sections are quite friendly to females as in there's a lot of women around (for my area at least). Strength/resistance areas are more male-centric, so it's just a matter of getting used to it and just do your own thing. Weekends are generally emptier, nights from 8+ onwards are also emptier, and they close at 10pm. Again, dependent on your area. You can actually check the gym capacity prior to visiting (App > Buy Pass > Gym Pass > View Gym Capacity). Cardio machines have a 30-min limit programmed into the machines to prevent people from hogging them, so you can be sure you're able to use the machine (even if it requires a short wait).

For first-timers downloading the app and registering for an account, there's a free $100 that's credited to your account to get you started. Each entry costs $2.50, and it'll be deducted from your free $100. After a few months when you're comfortable with your gym routine, then upgrade to AF so at least we're sure it's not money wasted.

The AF outlet near my place is running a 10% promo for $85.50/mth but I will be locked down for 18 months, vs. $75 for 12 months for the another AF outlet opening near work, but downside is it only opens in March. The opening rate is transferrable upon renewal (or so they say).

ActiveSG I know is a cheap alternative, but the heartland areas are not as convenient for me to get to from home or work, and I heard it gets really crowded during peak hours (after work) which is the only time I have available to workout. 

Should I just suck it up and sign up with the AF near my place for an extra $10.50 a month + additional 6 months commitment, or go with the lower opening AF fee + use ActiveSG in the meantime until March? Any advice?

One thing that always bugs me was how crowded my ActiveSG gym was (particularly after working hours). There was always some extra waiting involved. 

My AF here isn’t so crowded, and I like to go towards the night time anyways. It’s a nice feeling not having to share equipment. Means that you can either take your time if you’re in no rush or squeeze in that fast workout  if you’re rushing (the same 50min workout I can do in AF may take 1h30mins). 

If you’re new to the whole gym lifestyle, maybe just trying out the basic one will do bah. But in my personal opinion, crowded gyms just kill your mood to workout. I personally always felt like I wanted to GTFO ASAP instead of staying and always dreaded going. 

In contrast, I quite look forward to going to AF now. It’s quite therapeutic to go at night. There’s plenty of equipment and space to try different things and your workout is less likely to be interrupted. I would wager that if you went AF, it’ll be a more sustainable lifestyle. 

TLDR: ActiveSG good enough for teaser, AF more likely to provide good workouts and sustainable long term for your body goals.

Edit: you could always go ActiveSG short term before signing the home gym deal.",1,-0.6774,Negative

I'm at Evolve and that's bullshit, unless you have personal training. It ain't cheap, but not that high.

There are also gyms where you take class passes, maybe that's more worthwhile if booking slots fill up.",11,-0.0671,Negative

It does get cheaper year on year and on some promo months, you get shit loads of freebies. To note though, I think it's kinda strange if you join Evolve with the main purpose of lifting weights / doing conditioning classes. 

When I first joined, I knew nothing about martial arts so I rotated across the various classes - boxing, muay thai, bjj, fitness conditioning; they even had yoga back then! Eventually, I settled into training bjj, bcos it's just very difficult to get ""decent"" at something if you don't spend enough time on it. During my year 3-4, I added boxing to my routine due to the ""no-contact"" Covid-19 gym rules.

Personally, my membership with Evolve has worked out very well over the last 4-5yrs - I get to suspend the membership hassle-free whenever Im out for 3 continuous weeks (could be injury, sickness, travelling etc) so my 12mns usually last for a ~1.5yrs. Time to time, I consider alternatives such as FAMA, The Ring, Carpe Diem etc.. But in the end, I concluded that since I am the kind that 1) wants to train at anytime of the day, 2) practises more >1 martial art and 3) enjoy the friendships in the gym, Evolve still offers a far better value proposition.

One last note, I did wish I had joined a MMA gym (doesn't have to be Evolve, could be any) when I was much younger... Damn, all those non-productive years with FF, Pure & a little more way back - CF...",8,0.9753,Positive

When gyms opened up again after the first CB, FF had to reduce slots and it made booking classes even more difficult. Decided to quit because my $160 was really a waste of money at that point.

Joined Anytime and was doing strength-training for a while. Wasn't really into it so i decided to join my friends for a muay thai class at a tiny MMA gym in Balestier. Got hooked and decided to sign on for a 6 months unlimited classes package for around $1000 (usual price is $1200 but they were running a promo). I was and am still going up to 4-5 times weekly to train so my membership is damn worth it. Basically, if you don't mind basically no amenities and a little bit dinky, check out smaller MMA gyms.

Typically if you know how to train and can eat clean you'll see results. Look at people who do pure calesthenics or just about anyone who uses a regular gym. 

Places like f45, crossfit, spin cycles, mma is not exactly bad. But the selling point for them is the community. It sure is fun and on top of it you do get to learn skills and technique specifically in mma. (looking at you choke holds). Then again for cardio you can simply run which is free at the parks instead of going for spin. And for strength building, any fitness corner allows you to do pull-ups and if you can't there is always cheap resistance bands to help.

End of the day, I won't say that it is not worth the money. I've been to crossfit before and the motivation from the group helps. I've also been to personal training where I saw the most growth and results and quite frankly it is all about your goals and how sustainable your routine is.

I think 6am & 7am are also challenging, but I’ve never tried wee hrs morning classes myself. Some of the FES folks switch to Clarke Quay / Orchard bcos it’s easier to get evening classes.

There’s no monthly membership, but you can try asking if you were to cancel mid-way, what is the penalty - forfeiture or partial refund etc. From what I’ve seen, there’s a refund, presumably with legit reasons. Also, if you have dough to spare, there’s a select group of members who does not not pay for the annual membership, they buy privates in bulk.

& yes, I do agree with you that they can be more transparent with their pricing. But tbh, those who do end up joining the gym trains so often that on a per class / hour basis, it’s really really “cheap” for lessons. It’s not like you are figuring out things by yourself - there is instruction & more experienced partners are very willing to help the noobs.

That is really the key, then after youll probably already know this but having more muscle mass means you burn more just to maintain yourself even at rest and sleeping. This is why you see ultra fit people eating Jollibee and not putting as much fat as compared to regulars. And there is only so much muscle you can have at your abs so you need those back chest shoulders and legs too. 

The main problem I see with you is your schedule which can't be helped. So make sure you work around it by getting good rest. Night shift will really hold you back somewhat. Other than that as long as you keep active you'll be good to go, building muscles will help accelerate your goals and age will eventually catch up.

Of course there are gyms that range from $200/mo to $20/mo (Blink Fitness, for fellow NYCers wondering - Blink is excellent if you don't need classes, BTW). 


My membership at Fitness Firt used to be approx. $120/mo for comparable facilities. I've heard of $50 grandfathered plans but those are obviously for old timers. And the local neighborhood gyms were never an option given where I lived, furthermore they are very bare bones (no classes, towel service etc) from what I heard. 

NYC real estate is no less expensive than Singapore, if anything its more expensive!

Keep in mind that your only revenue source: Membership Signups (either Monthly, Annually or per session), Gym Instructor Sessions (either one to one or one to many) than you'll be fine.

I need your help to find a nice gym that will be convenient, has all the necessary equipment (bench press, squat machine, big plates etc.) and membership is under 100 SGD per month.

I want to avoid big corporate names like fitness first as I believe it is a major rip off to go to these places.

Some background info: I'm a soon to be 16yo student. Minimal experience with weightlifting, but back in Sec 2+3 I did some calisthenics, not sure exactly why I stopped. I'm looking to get back 'into shape', (pullup game weak af now), after exams end (heng ah no Os except for HCL). Plan to workout daily/alternate days til school reopens in Jan 17, then see how busy JC life is.

As you can partially tell from the title, what I am looking out for are the following:

-Located in Bedok area. I live at Bedok Reservoir (600+). Not necessarily the street name must have Bedok, but ideally travel time by bus/mrt to be below 30min.

-Reasonable combination of cost+quality. I dont want my money (read: my parents) to be thrown away for some atas gym membership, but sure as hell do not want to end up lifting a barbell with 2 rocks on the side. An exaggeration, but you get my point. Beyond my common sense I don't have much knowledge about pricing, so I definitely could use some tips here.

-Crowdedness. I read on here about some gyms being crowded and needing to queue. Idm if say need to wait for 1 person finish their set, but I'm not keen on queuing to enter the gym. I probably would be working out in the morning from 9+ or 10, or 3/4/5pm when hols haven't start. Again, input from frequent gym goers in relevant location gladly welcome.

-Equipment wise, nth too fancy. Main workout comprises of free weights. I will probably be doing rather standard stuff: deadlift, squat, bench press more or less confirmed, maybe some curls or shoulder raise etc with dumbell, lat pulldown/ pullups and treadmill cos 2.4 game weak af. I don't think there is much to be concerned about here.

Currently, the appealing choices are Gymboxx Bedok Reservoir/Bedok Point, or AnytimeFitness Bedok. I've looked at ActiveSG too, but outlet at Bedok seems less convenient acess wise. Gymboxx is more ex I noticed, at like $50 or $60 /month IIRC, for 3 months. But, what got my attention was a ripoff $30 admin fee wtf. It seems that the Bedok Point outlet would also be rather crowded, as much as it is spacious and well equipped. Otherwise it seems good. 

AnytimeFitness on first look the purple interior gave my eyes cancer and looked real small, but apparently the website claim 3k sq ft on 2 floors so maybe not that bad. Apparently dirt cheap membership, but advice on quality/availability of equipment and crowdedness needed.

Go to Bedok Stadium ActiveSG gym for $1.50 per entry. It's relatively cheap and there's one squat rack and bench press in the gym. I recommend going on weekdays, at most wait for 1 pair before u can use the bench/squat rack. If you lift around 10am in the morning or 2pm in the afternoon it will be alot less crowded, seriously. 

As for equipment, some of the plates and barbells are really really rusty. Just handle them with care. If not, you can try gymboxx since $60 per month is reasonable for their high standards of equipment as well as space. I think you should go for it if you lift frequently , like 3-4 times per week. I was lifting around 4 times per week when i was in secondary 4 but ActiveSG was good enough for me. ",6,0.8732,Positive

Get a trx suspension trainer (you can get a decent ""wallet friendly"" version for less then $40.. or get gymnastic rings, also around the same price). Get back to doing calisthenics, but with the suspension trainer. 

TRX pushups, leg assisted dips/pullups and rows are enough to build a solid upper body. Do assisted pistol squats (its basically squating ur own weight with 1 leg) until you can do them unassisted for your lower body. If you think suspension training is easy, you obviously never tried doing a flat angle row or pushup. 

If you are consistent, you be able to bang out pullups like nothing and move onto stuff like muscleups and planche pushups. You won't look huge, but you definitely look fit AF and without spending a lot of $$ on gym membership. Once you reach this stage, you can move onto the gym to hit heavy weights, or continue with weighted calisthenics, aka the greatest way to work out. ",0,0.9736,Positive

AnytimeFitness on first look the purple interior gave my eyes cancer and looked real small, but apparently the website claim 3k sq ft on 2 floors so maybe not that bad. Apparently dirt cheap membership, but advice on quality/availability of equipment and crowdedness needed.

53m82n,singapore,uMakeMeWet,20/9/2016 15:10,Cost efficient gyms in Bedok?,"Disclaimer: I did do some research on here/Google beforehand, but I felt that I could not make a wise decision yet with no experience so here I am. My post is rather long and detailed; gist of it is in TLDR.

Some background info: I'm a soon to be 16yo student. Minimal experience with weightlifting, but back in Sec 2+3 I did some calisthenics, not sure exactly why I stopped. I'm looking to get back 'into shape', (pullup game weak af now), after exams end (heng ah no Os except for HCL). Plan to workout daily/alternate days til school reopens in Jan 17, then see how busy JC life is.

As you can partially tell from the title, what I am looking out for are the following:

-Located in Bedok area. I live at Bedok Reservoir (600+). Not necessarily the street name must have Bedok, but ideally travel time by bus/mrt to be below 30min.

-Reasonable combination of cost+quality. I dont want my money (read: my parents) to be thrown away for some atas gym membership, but sure as hell do not want to end up lifting a barbell with 2 rocks on the side. An exaggeration, but you get my point. Beyond my common sense I don't have much knowledge about pricing, so I definitely could use some tips here.

-Crowdedness. I read on here about some gyms being crowded and needing to queue. Idm if say need to wait for 1 person finish their set, but I'm not keen on queuing to enter the gym. I probably would be working out in the morning from 9+ or 10, or 3/4/5pm when hols haven't start. Again, input from frequent gym goers in relevant location gladly welcome.

-Equipment wise, nth too fancy. Main workout comprises of free weights. I will probably be doing rather standard stuff: deadlift, squat, bench press more or less confirmed, maybe some curls or shoulder raise etc with dumbell, lat pulldown/ pullups and treadmill cos 2.4 game weak af. I don't think there is much to be concerned about here.

Currently, the appealing choices are Gymboxx Bedok Reservoir/Bedok Point, or AnytimeFitness Bedok. I've looked at ActiveSG too, but outlet at Bedok seems less convenient acess wise. Gymboxx is more ex I noticed, at like $50 or $60 /month IIRC, for 3 months. But, what got my attention was a ripoff $30 admin fee wtf. It seems that the Bedok Point outlet would also be rather crowded, as much as it is spacious and well equipped. Otherwise it seems good.

North - Marsiling (Near mrt), Sembawang (ssc there), Yishun don’t have the best one but the newer ones are Yishun east & Khoo Teck Phuat (size quite small however sufficient for any workout)

Central - Bishan (near mrt) , upper Thompson (beside the prata, last time 1 storey but now 2 storey) and amk south (2 storey, decent space)

East - Chai Chee (but a lot of powerlifters so if it’s overwhelming for u, can skip), Geylang Guillemard (nice layout very long like maze), Geylang central (big space and nice lighting), geylang (3 storey but can walkway slightly right), Bedok (djitsun mall there, staff quite friendly sometimes give free protein)

West - Bukit Batok csc (huge space and got big lounge area near the toilet), Jurong East summit (also a lot of powerlifters so if overwhelming for u can skip), D’arena (tucked in deep at Joo Koon, quite quiet)

South - Pasir Panjang (big squarish layout almost feel like i in jb lol), depot heights (new gym but layout still quite big, new machines coming soon I hope)

Just because you’ve never seen anyone get hurt doesn’t mean it’s not possible. Just because you’ve never dropped the weights doesn’t mean others won’t, especially if they try to imitate you after seeing Olympic lifts being performed in a general fitness gym.

For gym owners, why take the risk and headache of dealing with insurance claims, injury reports, or damaged equipment? Why risk scaring off other members who feel unsafe or uncomfortable? The cost-benefit just isn’t there.

While I understand your frustration and passion for your sport, there’s a right place for everything. Unfortunately, a public gym isn’t the right environment for Olympic weightlifting. If you signed up for a gym without checking whether that type of lifting was allowed, that’s ultimately on you.

Trying to snake your way around the rules — just because it’s technically possible, or because it wasn’t explicitly blacklisted at first, or “well, it’s not explicitly banned, so I can do it” mindset — isn’t a good mindset from the start. 

Gym rules exist to protect members and the business, not to restrict passion. If the gym isn’t designed or insured for a certain type of training, then it’s simply not the place for it. 

If you truly love Olympic lifting, find a facility built for it — one that has proper platforms, equipment, and insurance coverage. That way, you can train freely, and gym owners can maintain a safe and fair space for everyone",7,0.7666,Positive

Cheers 🍻",63,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeFitness/comments/1o3o57v/best_anytime_fitness_in_town/,55,"This thread has gone off on a tangent for long enough so I'll say my final piece and we can agree to disagree thereafter.

My main point is that the ""concerns of safety, risks and overhead involved"" are unfounded and not necessarily backed up by evidence. Anything is ""possible"", but do we really see it happening on the ground? Have you seen it? I certainly haven't in my 20 years of lifting. There are Youtube videos of epic gym fails where lifters drop the barbell from overhead at an awkward angle and hits someone. But the same videos also show benchers or squatters getting pinned (in fact, people have actually died from this), yet benching and squatting isn't prohibited. And let me be clear - these are freak accidents that happen so infrequently, you might as well stop using smartphones because several Galaxy Note 8 batteries exploded a decade ago. There is only a perceived risk of the unfamiliar, and to me, the reaction of prohibiting it because it's unfamiliar is just lazy. Sure, as a gym owner, I can take these ""precautions"" to supposedly reduce freak accidents from happening, at the cost of excluding a small group of lifters. If I'm just a franchisee with no interest in fitness, I may do the same thing - just run it like a laundromat and profit. But it's not necessarily right, it's just easy and convenient.

Fitness and exercises are constantly evolving. 60 years ago powerlifting wasn't a thing. 30 years ago Crossfit wasn't a thing. 10 years ago Hyrox wasn't a thing. It takes time to accept and to perform sports safely, and with education, that time can be reduced. Despite Olympic lifting existing from the 1st modern Olympics, I'm aware it's still a niche sport. But let's not kid ourselves by saying it's dangerous when the evidence over the past 100+ years doesn't show this.

Next, gym rules are there for reasons - for safety, for comfort and consideration, for cleanliness, for equipment longevity. I don't ""snake around"" these rules. I respect and abide by them, both by the spirit and the letter. If the rules say no chalk, it's obviously for cleanliness, so I don't use it, and I also put back the equipment after use. If the rules say no slamming of weights, it's for noise and equipment longevity, so I don't dump them overhead (even though ironically the equipment are designed for it). But if one is following both the spirit and letter of the law, exhibiting behaviours that are reasonably safe and considerate, yet the gym still have a bone to pick with him, then that protects nobody, and just marginalises somebody.

Lastly, what's ironic about your last paragraph is that majority of AF outlets, and in fact all the AF outlets that I've practised Olympic lifting in has the proper equipment - platforms, bumper plates, bars with needle bearings that spin (some even have Eleiko WL bars). These are explicitly designed for Olympic lifting, including dropping from overhead. Don't believe me? Check the manufacturer's website. Obviously one shouldn't be doing that at a gym with rusty metal plates and sleeve bushing bars, and deserves to be chased out for not respecting the equipment, but that's not what's happening here. As for insurance, every gym contract has a liability waiver that releases the gym from legal responsbility for damages incurred during use of the facility, so that isn't even an issue. In the end, I fundamentally disagree that public gyms are not the right environment for any sport, as long as the development of that sport requires gym equipment, and it doesn't break any rules by the spirit or letter. I'm there to train, not to make other gym members happy. It's also Olympic lifting, I'm not riding a horse in the gym.",-3,0.9524,Positive

with olympic lifting, you are snatching, moving heavy weight fast and overhead. people may lose balance, fall back, hit other people, destroy other equipment/machines, especially if the AF outlet is a small one, which most gyms are relatively tight spaced in SG. Some gyms are on higher levels, when you slam the weight from shoulder height it'll cause the downstairs tenants to be disturbed, especially an issue if it is a shop or restaurant of some kind.

not to mention inexperienced people may see you do it and try it without knowing how to do such movements and injure themselves or others or the property (granted this wouldn't be your fault)

there are specialised gyms for this, even those hyrox and crossfit gyms accomodate to these exercises. just use your critical thinking skills",3,-0.4588,Negative

Hi all, I need advice on an issue with Anytime Fitness.

[17 Mar] Signed up at a branch near my house. Paid $898 upfront for what I was told was a 12-month membership (with discounts).

Early Jun: Transferred to a branch near my workplace.

[1 Sep]: Found an extra $98 deduction from my bank, no invoice or email.

[2 Sep]: Contacted both branches. Both pushed me to the other.

Workplace branch: said my “initial term ends 28/03/2026” and I’m on a monthly contract.

Original branch: never reached out despite being told they would by the workplace branch.

[6 Sep]: Followed up with the original branch.

[7 Sep]: They claimed the money i paid (did not specify the amount) was only covered until Aug 2025, and I’ll be charged monthly from Sep 2025.

This doesn’t make sense because:

I was told $898 was for 12 full months (from Mar 2025).

They started charging me again in Sep 2025, only 5 months in.

Monthly membership is usually $80–100, so the numbers don’t add up.

Despite asking twice, I still haven’t received an invoice/record of my $898 payment.

[7 Sep]: They claimed the money i paid (did not specify the amount) was only covered until Aug 2025, and I’ll be charged monthly from Sep 2025.

This doesn’t make sense because:

I was told $898 was for 12 full months (from Mar 2025).

They started charging me again in Sep 2025, only 5 months in.

Monthly membership is usually $80–100, so the numbers don’t add up.

Despite asking twice, I still haven’t received an invoice/record of my $898 payment.

So I followed up with “so it’s just a matter of changing my home gym, no changes to fees or need to pay penalty”.

[2 Sep]: Contacted both branches. Both pushed me to the other.

Workplace branch: said my “initial term ends 28/03/2026” and I’m on a monthly contract.

Original branch: never reached out despite being told they would by the workplace branch.

[6 Sep]: Followed up with the original branch.

[7 Sep]: They claimed the money i paid (did not specify the amount) was only covered until Aug 2025, and I’ll be charged monthly from Sep 2025.

This doesn’t make sense because:

I was told $898 was for 12 full months (from Mar 2025).

They started charging me again in Sep 2025, only 5 months in.

Monthly membership is usually $80–100, so the numbers don’t add up.

Despite asking twice, I still haven’t received an invoice/record of my $898 payment.

Has anyone faced something similar with Anytime Fitness? What’s the best way to get this resolved?

Be very careful with AF. 
There are some AFs that are owned by the same owner. If you see your gym advertising services or classes for other gyms, that could be a hint that they share the same franchise owner. Bouncing between those gyms would probably be better but I don’t know for sure.

I’ve been an AF user for years and I also find some of their business practices to be very shady. Seems like most of their staff are young interns and temp workers. Might not be very well trained or experienced to tell you everything you need to know when you sign up. Odds are, they’re probably as clueless as you. 

In any case, just be sure to tap in your home gym every so often. On weekends or when you get home from work just go tap. Don’t necessarily have to work out. Try to “visit” your home gym more than other gyms.",4,0.7748,Positive

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Update: They called me and said after further investigation, they decided to waiver the fee and all this happened was due to a new staff's inexperience.🫠",786,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1h33dqr/anytime_fitness_wants_me_to_pay_60/,1,"I don’t know sh*t about gyms here, but AF charge people 60 dollars for not ensuring the security of their own premises???

1h33dqr,askSingapore,JovSkywalker_66,30/11/2024 11:22,Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60,"

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

I think AF ended up backing down and refunding the user - but ONLY because it blew up. The most important discussion point was that AF could EASILY solve this problem by investing in turnstile gate systems that only allow one person to enter at a time, and create another side entrance with normal swing doors exclusive for staff and equipment and persons with special needs.

AF is choosing not to do that, and instead resorts to this bullshit system. It's not my duty as a paying customer to prevent others from entering the gym behind me, even if your company wants to insist that it is.

I quit AF because it was very small, very crowded, very poorly maintained, and very poorly lit. Their policies and practices are just another bonus reason. Oh, and their prices keep going up for no goddamn reason (at least, no reason from a consumer perspective, there's no new value add).",69,0.4659,Positive

A few times they have overcharged me on monthly bills. Only when i called them to declare they said they will look into it. In the end i had to approach the gym outlet owner and explain to him what was going on to get it solved. 

Secondly they will play around with their t&c. When i cancelled my membership i froze my account. They said need to unfreeze and pay for the last month even though i have no access to the gym. Some more it says nowhere in their t&c that u cant cancel when ur account is frozen.",6,0.163,Positive

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

I'm sure they wouldn't want to lose a monthly retainer to a one time payment. But if you're going to do this be prepared and ready Incase they do ban you.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Many businesses does that, big or small.

Seriously, what entitlement them do they have, to ""waiver"" or ""out of good will""  of you? You did nothing, you shouldn't even pay anything from the very beginning, yet you suffered, and have to go through no matter how big or small or insignificant, you still go thru with sorting out the mess?

They should be giving you vouchers instead and compensating you for the trouble of it caused by them and their staff or at the very least apologies. 

Not guilt tripping you. Oh out of good will we have waive the fee for you. What 60 dollars? What good will? It should never have existed. For asking 60 dollars of fine for something you didn't do, it fair practice businesses should be willing to part with the same amount of 60$ as compensation. 

If it was me and I have done it before, I'll tell them to keep their good will don't need it, and cancel and cut ties. It's not their place to forgive and forget but they made it that way they let you think you're the problem and they forgive you.",3,-0.642,Negative

More like they're trying their luck here, they'll milk and juice consumers from every possible angle. Had a bad experience with them regarding payment issues. Apparently their billing date is on the 1st of every month, if deduction on that day fails, a $15 billing fee will be charged as a penalty. 5-7 days later, another attempt at deduction will occur, if it fails again, another $15. Typically everyone in SG draws their salary on the 7th, but just look at how scummy they are. When confronted regarding the extra charges, they'll just brush you off saying that it's charged by EzPay and not them. According to them, there's nothing they can do about it, even if it's about raising a request to EzPay on your behalf to have the fees waived. See the pattern here? They partnered EzPay for giro payment services and when problems arise, they just dodge everything. If it wasn't for the convenience and 24H operation, I'd jump ship to another gym.",3,-0.9262,Negative

1. You do not work for AF. It is not your job to prevent people from tailgating you.

2. It is an offence if video exhibits evidence that you know the person and assisted him in entering without tapping in.

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Seems AF is another example of corporatations making money by charging as much as possible for the least cost, rather than focusing on delivering a great product or service so people will be happy to spend money on them.",2,0.7906,Positive

Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Update: They called me and said after further investigation, they decided to waiver the fee and all this happened was due to a new staff's inexperience.🫠",786,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1h33dqr/anytime_fitness_wants_me_to_pay_60/,152,So doing guard duty in NS is actually a useful skill outside of the army too after all. /s,18,0.4404,Positive

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Update: They called me and said after further investigation, they decided to waiver the fee and all this happened was due to a new staff's inexperience.🫠",786,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1h33dqr/anytime_fitness_wants_me_to_pay_60/,189,"but you're obviously not the target group of AF or any of the higher end gyms. I have went to active, AF and a fitnessfirst equivalent.

Activesg: not sure if you noticed, most of the goers are either seniors, students or people with time to spare. Of course, now there's a human traffic indicator on the app but it's still packed af and I will still need to take 1.5 to 2 times longer than my normal routine. Especially when my cool down is using a cardio machine, all the treadmill or stairmaster are always taken. To which of course I walk home or take the stairs etc. So it's really for people with budget, or time to spare. 

AF (using this now): this gym is really for people who wanna workout at anytime, no pun intended. Go to any AF, there's bound to be someone there at all times. Its price is half of what other commercial gyms listed. Hence, it's still slightly more packed but I can complete my routine within the amount of time I have planned for already and there's usually more specific equipment as compared to activesg. 

For the higher end gyms: this gym is really not targeted at the normal crowd. I have met business owners, highflyers, bankers, VPs at these gyms, hence some people even do business when working out lol, theres literally a lounge for this purpose. And needless to say the crowds here are way lesser than AF. There's free towels provided for when you wanna wash up after your workout. There are classes such as yoga, spin class, HIT.

TLDR: activesg is for budget conscious gymgoers with time to spare. AF is for gymgoers who wanna gym at anytime or have a lesser crowd to compete equipment with. Higher ends is really for people who the space, conduciveness, and services.",13,0.8957,Positive

so to make a profit you need to increase the number of people that attend your gym, either through new memberships or pooching existing members from other gyms

So, point one- space is cheap and is spiralling.

Point two- and this is what many don't know- malls are often giving away space (this is big in the West at the moment) for any thing that \_ensures people show up in the district\_. Arcades, movies and- you got it- gyms. These spaces encourage foot fall, and people coming in and out of the gyms will want trainers, juice, yoga mats and a big mac- so it's a net effect.

TLDR: Online shopping makes these big spaces cheap for gyms, and in many cases are given away to encourage people to frequent a commercial space creating a net positive for neighbouring businesses.",13,0.9519,Positive

1kuy0kl,askSingapore,RedAutumFall,25/5/2025 16:51,"Can't decide whether to get gym membership. Which would you choose if you were me (E.g. active sg, anytime fitness)","So I want to get into fitness, but knowing myself I dont have the discipline to do it. However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

There are a lot of home workouts at home that involve using dumbbells which you can purchase.  Besides the last thing a newbie should do is go near a barbell. I mean you can try machines but machines also have their own learning curve. 

So my best tip is to learn proper form with dumbbells first then once you get confident then go the gym. 

Also a lot of people workout during lunchtime. If yours is a desk job then you can use that 1 hour to workout or even 30 mins a few times a week is good enough. Start slow and slowly build up your stamina to workout longer.

However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner.

However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,18,which outlet is having the $80 promo?

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Like you, I was a bit wary of joining a gym with too long a commitment period. So my package with amore is for 48 entries within a 12-month period. It's $99 per month for 12 months. And I've been using it to visit amore once a week. I like that it's a female gym, and I feel comfortable using the squat rack without the men hogging it all the time. There's also a lot of space to do floor exercises. But, they are limited in terms of the machines they have. 

So for machines, I still visit activesg gym, since that was where I first started and I'm familiar with the machines they have. 

I think it's a good balance between the two so far and I'm happy with my choice. 

I would suggest approaching the gyms for a free trial first to see if you even like the vibes of the place.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,36,"Since you are starting on this journey new, pick the one with the least amount of effort to get there.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

- Money is a strong motivation 
- Cheaper than AF, Snap & Amore.
- You not have to commit the membership first, can do $9 per entry as trial THEN make the decision to join as member which will further your motivation.
- ^ that said, Active SG will not make it since you only pay when you are there.
- You might start to enjoy the journey there. Although it depends on what you mean by 35mins away. Is this based on walking? Bus? MRT? A combination? This info is needed because if you meant by foot, this path can be a warm up for your gymming session. :)

3. Watch on youtube and learn the movements. Probably before going to the gym and while at the gym.  
4. Plan out a gym routine, what to do, number of sets, weight, and muscle group to prevent working it out consecutively.  
5. Work with others to alternate using the machine/bar if there’s people using it.  

There’s innately a lot of steps to motivate yourself to get through. I thought money was a big motivator for me, turns out it wasn’t enough for all of them. In the end, i settled on gym classes because it solves steps 3-5 for me, which i don’t feel well equipped to plan. It is more expensive, but I figured I needed the exercise with a sedentary work lifestyle. I use the money as the motivator for steps 1-2.",1,0.8869,Positive

Which would you choose if you were me (E.g. active sg, anytime fitness)","So I want to get into fitness, but knowing myself I dont have the discipline to do it. However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,54,"Huh your post is full of excuses.
 Get into fitness BEFORE you buy a gym membership. Run outside, swim in the activesg pools, use the exercise parks available in every estate. After you've kept to it for 3-6 months then you will know which gym membership suits your needs best. Good luck!!

Going to the gym and seeing progress is a LONG process, so a 15 month lock in period could be the push factor that helps you eventually see some progress. At the end of the day, exercising/gymming sucks. You’re gonna have days where you just wanna stop gymming. Having an inconvenient gym just makes it all the more easier to give up. Minimise the barriers so that you’re more likely to stick to gymming. 

As for fear of being judged, there is SO MUCH information available online with video tutorials etc. If you find free weights or big movements like squats and bench press intimidating, it’s OK! Anytime Fitness has plenty of machines that basically force you to do the exercise correctly. Do some research and come up with a simple routine to begin with using simple machines. That’s what I did. Eventually I learned more advanced exercises by observing the more experienced people in the gym and silently learning what they’re doing. 

TLDR: choose convenience and minimise barriers. Working out already sucks, don’t overcomplicate things and make it harder than it already is.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,62,Because Im already almost always late for work haha.

However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead.

Which would you choose if you were me (E.g. active sg, anytime fitness)","So I want to get into fitness, but knowing myself I dont have the discipline to do it. However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose.

And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,81,How do you evaluate if its a good branch?,1,0.4404,Positive

And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,90,Huh which branch is there $45/ month for 12 month contract?,1,0,Neutral

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner.

Which would you choose if you were me (E.g. active sg, anytime fitness)","So I want to get into fitness, but knowing myself I dont have the discipline to do it. However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose.

There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,109,[removed],1,0,Neutral

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,118,I mean I dont really need the pool since I already have free access to several pools around Singapore though it does sound really nice!,1,0.7707,Positive

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

Mentally you will feel so much better. 

The reason why you can't seem commit is because once you reach home the momentum to go out again just to do something is incredibly high. The problem is that for most people the moment they reach home, that's where they mentally start to relax and once you do you feel way way more tired to do stuff. 

The best thing you can do is gym after work, no matter how tired you are because that will be the least tired you are for the day, just remember you might be tired now but you will be even more tired later. At some point, you'll eventually develop the energy to gym after work but that takes time and effort. 

The most important thing to remember is this, doing something less efficiently is better than not doing anything, better to do something in your free work gym than to wait for the right moment. That's why so many people fail they wait for the best time, they tell themselves tomorrow will be better moment than just doing when they can

The other thing is please please please don't overcommit yourself, you say you want to do classes and swim and gym when you say your struggle to commit. That's a recipe for disaster, you'll miss one day and your momentum will crash immediately because the taste of rest is far nicer than the success you see. Try this instead, tell yourself to just go to the gym twice a week or even just do whatever for twice a week. That's more than enough, you don't need to go 4 days a week to gym, swim, yoga and pilates to be fit. 

The only downside to gym after work is that you will end up shifting your dinner from 6pm after work to well past 9pm which for some people they cannot handle. The advice is to maybe have fruit or snack an hour before your exercise so that you don't crash. If you don't, the upside is that you'll be technically on a mild fasted state so your body will have to convert fat for energy. 

As for how to gym, there are a lot of resources online, but to actually know what to follow you need a very specific goal, strength or body physique? Being healthy isn't a goal in gym, because anything can achieve that you need a target so that when you search for gym exercises, you will know if it is achieving your goal or is useless information.

Try this first before committing to a gym membership, build your lifestyle slowly one change at a time. Do it until you don't think about it and still do it.",17,0.982,Positive

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",37,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,136,"Can cancel one, just need to pay cancellation/early termination fee, which is only slightly cheaper than continuing the membership",0,-0.34,Negative

It doesnt automatically get you out of your debt dispute, but if for some reason they charge your card after this date, you have solid proof for a chargeback.
Cancelling the card doesnt automatically stop payments. For recurring payments that are not fraud, its actually allowed at the banks discretion to move that charge over to your new card automatically.  In face theres a service merchants can subscribe to through their bank, where for card in file transactions, they can automatically be informed of your replacement card credential and continue to charge it. That's why you must tell the gym, you stop your permission to auto charge your card from now on. And keep proof of this (eg email), or if by phone, make a note of date/time/persons name. As I said it won't make any debt dispute go away, but it means they cant keep charging your card automatically.

Even if it was crowded, it was still pretty okay. AC was usually strong and good. Staff friendly. 

Worse imo- buangkok AF. EXTREMELY CROWDED on weekday nights (have to wait over 30-40mins for a bench), rude people everywhere hogging equipment while playing on their phones. Cramped af because it was overcrowded with equipment. AC frequently down 😔 

I spotted cockroaches, baby lizards, ants… toilet had piss sprayed all over the toilet seat on several occasions, I hope whoever did that has left the gym for good now 🤢The equipment (especially the lat pulldown and rear delt fly machines) were also generally badly maintained, partly because of a select few gym regulars who slammed the weights down by letting go of the bar at the bottom-most part of the lat pull down 🌚

Gym staff did nothing to stop a pervy elderly man from openly staring very intently at a lady’s bum when she was doing barbell squats (his head was literally moving up and down along with her bum, as a female who sometimes did squats in that same location she did, it totally scared me from doing squats there) and the lady even reported it to the staff. It took a member of the gym making an official police report + the police coming down to the gym for the gym staff to cancel the pervy elderly man’s gym membership. Gym staff was generally very apathetic to feedback, with the exception of 1 temp chinese dude with curly hair (he did a great job but he only worked there for a few months, sadly)",1,0.501,Positive

A friend of mine is thinking of joining AF. I am an existing member myself. They’ve done well to modernize gym access options, to include phone access via Apple Wallet now. For existing gym members that’s good as we don’t have to bring our keyfobs around. Needless to say, it doesn’t cost money to use your phone. 

For new-joiners, it’s an absolute shitshow because you’re still required to pay $95 one-time for a keyfob even if you have no intention to use it at all. 

They’re not allowing people to opt out of this fee at sign-up. Now they’re twisting shit up and renaming it to an “access fee” where you pay $95 to have access rights to the gym. Aren’t we already paying $$ monthly to ACCESS the gym?

Also, it doesn’t make sense for each member to fork out an additional $95 one-time solely for a door-access system, but they’re positioning it as such. If their door-access system is so costly and high-tech (for what?) then I guess this would be an entirely different conversation. 

If a small low-experience company had such a payment model that didn’t make sense, we won’t pay and we’d probably understand. For someone as established as AF to be positioning their payment model in this ridiculous way still, after so many years in operation - that’s just beyond embarrassing.

I’ll save you the “if you don’t like, don’t pay” because that’s exactly what we’re doing :)

What are your thoughts on this? What other business out there have such nonsensical models?",149,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1hhrsub/anytime_fitness_keyfob_fee/,6,"Let me explain what this fee is. 

So anytime fitness is a huge global franchise. Before anyone buys this franchise, they provide a financial projection to tell you the different revenue streams and estimated revenue you will make and the fees that the franchisor (owner of anytime fitness) will collect from them. 

What is likely is that this key fob fee is part of a ""welcome package"" that is in the proposed revenue stream and is likely charged to the franchisee in Singapore who opens the gym, to register you into the IT system. Every new user is a cost in the IT System. Sure there is a mark up, but nonetheless, a revenue that was already projected. 

Hope this helps!",38,0.9141,Positive

A friend of mine is thinking of joining AF. I am an existing member myself. They’ve done well to modernize gym access options, to include phone access via Apple Wallet now. For existing gym members that’s good as we don’t have to bring our keyfobs around. Needless to say, it doesn’t cost money to use your phone. 

For new-joiners, it’s an absolute shitshow because you’re still required to pay $95 one-time for a keyfob even if you have no intention to use it at all. 

They’re not allowing people to opt out of this fee at sign-up. Now they’re twisting shit up and renaming it to an “access fee” where you pay $95 to have access rights to the gym. Aren’t we already paying $$ monthly to ACCESS the gym?

Also, it doesn’t make sense for each member to fork out an additional $95 one-time solely for a door-access system, but they’re positioning it as such. If their door-access system is so costly and high-tech (for what?) then I guess this would be an entirely different conversation.

For new-joiners, it’s an absolute shitshow because you’re still required to pay $95 one-time for a keyfob even if you have no intention to use it at all. 

They’re not allowing people to opt out of this fee at sign-up. Now they’re twisting shit up and renaming it to an “access fee” where you pay $95 to have access rights to the gym. Aren’t we already paying $$ monthly to ACCESS the gym?

Also, it doesn’t make sense for each member to fork out an additional $95 one-time solely for a door-access system, but they’re positioning it as such. If their door-access system is so costly and high-tech (for what?) then I guess this would be an entirely different conversation. 

If a small low-experience company had such a payment model that didn’t make sense, we won’t pay and we’d probably understand. For someone as established as AF to be positioning their payment model in this ridiculous way still, after so many years in operation - that’s just beyond embarrassing.

when you pay your keyfob fee, you arent paying for the physical item. you are actually paying for a digital token that is attributed to your name in their system (their worldwide system). so, this payment does not regard to the physical token/digital token.

as to WHY such a digitsl token costs alot, im not sure, maybe theres a sophisticated back-end requiring this number.

A friend of mine is thinking of joining AF. I am an existing member myself. They’ve done well to modernize gym access options, to include phone access via Apple Wallet now. For existing gym members that’s good as we don’t have to bring our keyfobs around. Needless to say, it doesn’t cost money to use your phone. 

For new-joiners, it’s an absolute shitshow because you’re still required to pay $95 one-time for a keyfob even if you have no intention to use it at all. 

They’re not allowing people to opt out of this fee at sign-up. Now they’re twisting shit up and renaming it to an “access fee” where you pay $95 to have access rights to the gym. Aren’t we already paying $$ monthly to ACCESS the gym?

Also, it doesn’t make sense for each member to fork out an additional $95 one-time solely for a door-access system, but they’re positioning it as such. If their door-access system is so costly and high-tech (for what?) then I guess this would be an entirely different conversation. 

If a small low-experience company had such a payment model that didn’t make sense, we won’t pay and we’d probably understand. For someone as established as AF to be positioning their payment model in this ridiculous way still, after so many years in operation - that’s just beyond embarrassing.

It's not supposed to make sense to the user. It's just a way for the business to make money. Welcome to the world of business.

Aside from the likely explanation that this fee has some basis in cost but is inflated by markups at every stage (a very typical way of charging money in various industries), it's also likely a way to earn some money upfront for the purposes of cash flow and minimising risk. Having money now is better than having money later, and there's always some risk that you won't get the full amount you were expecting. Hence the concept of interest payments, which gives someone a reason not to demand money upfront. And which kind of exists for gym memberships too, hence paying a lump sum for one or two years' membership often works out to be cheaper than paying monthly.

Businesses don't really give a shit about you. Or rather, they give as few shits as they can get away with. Sometimes they might give too few and end up making losses. That happens too often, but hey, business people are as dumb as anyone, I guess.",12,-0.431,Negative

Don’t be too caught up by the labels - a fee is a fee. The govt charges hefty sums for “stamp duties” when you buy property, but nobody really thinks that’s the cost of an actual stamp. 

At the end of the day, a dollar paid under any label is still a dollar. We should just add up the total price, and see whether the product is worth the price.

On a practical note, the new year is coming soon, and AF often has discounts or waiver of fees then. No harm waiting a while to see what offer comes up. And please don’t be caught up by what fee they waive (joining fee, fob fee etc) - a dollar saved is a dollar saved, whatever the label.

They’re not allowing people to opt out of this fee at sign-up. Now they’re twisting shit up and renaming it to an “access fee” where you pay $95 to have access rights to the gym. Aren’t we already paying $$ monthly to ACCESS the gym?

Also, it doesn’t make sense for each member to fork out an additional $95 one-time solely for a door-access system, but they’re positioning it as such. If their door-access system is so costly and high-tech (for what?) then I guess this would be an entirely different conversation. 

If a small low-experience company had such a payment model that didn’t make sense, we won’t pay and we’d probably understand. For someone as established as AF to be positioning their payment model in this ridiculous way still, after so many years in operation - that’s just beyond embarrassing.

Using the Low Cost Carrier financial model, I sell flight tickets for cheaper than Full Service Carrier. However, LCC charges additional for all other ancillary service and product. A serving of Instant Noodles cost $7, for example, which one can buy from a convenience store for $3. Thus, their profit margins for the Instant Noodles are through the roof, which then subsidies the lower margins for selling the flight tickets cheaper. LCC uses the same financial model for check in luggage. Ryanair in the UK even toyed with the of charging for passengers to use aircraft lavatories. This idea was shut down by the UK government.

Fast forward to now, coming June is the month that it resumes. Been trying to reach out to Ja***** (iykyk) the manager, only to be left hanging. She literally went MIA mid conversation last night, and it's already 12pm now, but still single tick. Another staff member A* is using the same method, to MIA completely. My first texts to him were sent last evening ~6pm, it's Sunday so I understand the lack of response, but it's already Monday afternoon now. They insist that I can only book a cancellation appointment once the membership resumes. My payment date falls on the 2nd of the month, which means that I will be paying for an extra month for nothing. ?????? Desperate here, can some kind soul please help me.

I’m saying it’s not worth the trouble to dispute with the club, which may terminate one’s membership if one refuses to pay

I thought I could rely on ActiveSG gym and not sign up for AF. However, the ActiveSG (Tampines) that I visited:

\- Had little showers  
\- Lots of people throughout the day  
\- Only operational from 7am to 10pm  
\- Lots of people hogging, chatting at the machines

What eventually pushed me to go for AF was that the aircon was spoiled for weeks. That made the gym warm and unbearable.

I've not been to Woodlands ActiveSG before so I can't comment on that.

The plus side for me of signing up AF was the convenience. Nowadays I wake up at 5am to gym, and can go to any outlet I want. Sure, some outlets have limited showers or can be crowded during peak hours. But I don't think it'll be as crowded as ActiveSG.

The one at Woodlands North is smaller but I think it's better cuz less people go there, even on weekends and the equipment is more well maintained.

OP, double check the wording in your contract and be firm. I had the same issue before (heard a few chain owners like to do this to get more from cancellations) and in the end they followed the stipulated 1 month notice per the contract.

Worst case you can pay for the month, but be clear you provided 1 month notice, and don't use the gym after that month, and go to SCT to claim the extra 1 month charged as they are effectively charging you 2 months to cancel instead of one. I can't recall off the top of my head but its a 10 - 20 fee to submit the claim. Provide all communications and your contract as well as a clear summary, should be an open/shut case.

EDIT: My bad, Its late and I didn't read this right. My case was more straightforward as I gave notice at the end of the ""admin period"" but they delayed responding for a couple of days, essentially making me have to pay another month. In OP's case, it will be additional work but they should be able to pro-rate the next charge.

EDIT2 - curious why i got downvotes for this.

1. Try to plan a weekly schedule in advance and target major muscle groups of the body instead of focusing on specific muscles. Your 1st priority should be building overall core strength first.
2. Go for chest press , shoulder press machines, machine rows. Do weekly deadlifts on smith machines.
3. Don't go ego mode. Focus on ramping sets up slowly as you adjust your overall strength condition

I strongly recommend getting a trainer to start if you can afford it. The big compound movements really benefit from somebody that know what they are doing to help you make sure your form is good, which helps training outcomes but more importantly stops you from hurting yourself. 

2. Pick a program, theres a ton of online resources. If you get a trainer, they can help you pick / build one. As long as they are not moronic (like 7 days a week, 2 hr per session all out failure every set), they pretty much all work, just pick the one that fits your schedule and you are comfortable with.

3. Once you have a program, follow it. If you dont feel like going, promise yourself you will go and do 1 set of 1 rep of your first exercise, and then you can go home if you still dont feel up for it. 

4. If it hurts, stop. Start light to figure out what is hurts and what is muscle soreness.

5. Gym etiquette. Wipe down weights after use, put dumbbell and plates back after use, dont hog multiple machines and/or weights, dont work out directly in front of the racks.",11,0.7228,Positive

Dont get hung up if you didn't hit your targets or can't see results, enjoy the routine (very important to have routine as already posted by others) and find meaning in the process. It's always easier to relook and adjust steps in the process when you don't hit your goals.

Find the Anytime Fitness nearest to your lifestyle route (i.e.: located somewhere best suited to your lifestyle.

Read the machine instructions. 
Try with low load, high reps.
See how you feel the next few days
Increase the load next week

As you get used to the machines and exercises
Research and read about what else you can do to adjust to your routine.


For beginners, its important to just start out with lighter loads and experience the after effects. As you get a hang of things, you tweak your trainings.

As you get more regular, research training programs and progressive overloading. Then look to supplementation if you are getting serious.

Going in hard and fast is an express ticket to injury and failure to habituate. 1st year goals are to get a hang of things, and make exercise a habit. Having a strict plan is difficult for beginners in a public gym and can cause frustrations.

If you don’t do this you will be other spend 4 hours at the gym each time or leave without finishing your workout. 

2) google (or ChatGPT) a good lifting routine for beginners and stick to it. Start light, even if it seems too light. Each time you go, stick on a tiny bit more weight or use a heavier dumbbell. In no time your weights will increase and you will also increase in size as a result. Bodybuilding is not rocket science despite the numerous videos online.

4) go to the gym even if you feel like shit and don’t leave until you finish your routine. The hardest lift is to step out of the house. Once you’re out and at the gym the odds of you not doing your workout will become close to zero. 

5) I WFH pretty often so those are my gym days. I go to the gym at 7.30 am when it’s empty. Only downside is you need more warming up at that early.


I’ve been using the Jim Stoppani shortcut to size for years. I feel like it works for me, but that doesn’t mean it’ll be great for you. It may be too tough on a beginner.

First off, congratulations on taking this step towards a healthier lifestyle. It's not always easy to make these changes, especially when dealing with a hectic schedule, but your determination is commendable.     
  
  Remember, everyone at the gym started where you are now. Don't be intimidated by others, instead, use them as motivation. Focus on your own progress and celebrate your own victories, no matter how small they may seem.     
  
  The key to building a habit is consistency. Try to schedule your gym time just like any other important appointment. It might be hard at first, but it will soon become a part of your routine.     
  
  Don't be afraid to ask for help or advice from the trainers at the gym. They are there to assist you and can provide valuable tips to improve your workouts.     
  
  Start with lighter weights and gradually increase as your strength improves. Listen to your body and don't push yourself too hard in the beginning to avoid injuries.     
  
  Remember, this is a journey and not a race. Progress might be slow, but what's important is that you're making strides towards a healthier lifestyle. Keep up the great work and don't forget to enjoy the process. Good luck!",1,0.995,Positive

It also comes down to your preference.

On food, a general rule of thumb would be to not consume smth too heavy right before in case you feel bloated. But if you’re someone who finds that you exercise better with an empty stomach, go for it so long you don’t end up becoming light-headed. Do some trial and error.

On supplements, that’d depend on what are those supplements. If it’s just protein/creatine/fish oil etc, then the timing doesn’t really matter. 

Ultimately it’s more about what you consume in total for the day and for the week. 

On cardio & weights, you can find a lot of talk about the “interference effect” yada yada, but at the end of the day you should be choosing what matters more to you first. Are your cardio goals more impt atm? Do that first or vice-versa. If they’re on equal grounds then it’s really up to you.

I had asked the new gym if I were to transfer over, would I have to pay their rate. They said yes (approx $110/mth), so I didn’t officially change home club. 

After 2 months of frequently visiting this new gym, the system changed my home club and the new gym emailed me to welcome me. They didn’t charge me more either and I continued paying my existing rate! The new gym’s staff were all very nice as well. So I think it depends on the management of the club :)

Location: The closer the better, the extra travel time - no matter how little - will be something that could weigh on you when deciding whether to go or not, especially if it involves taking public transport.

Options: Access any branch 24/7 means if you have or make friends who go to other branches, you always have the option of going to find them there which is a big possibility as you get more into gymming/weightlifting.

Then there’s a few powerlifter type that hogs the power rack, must take a video of every set they do even if it looks like their warm up set. They must set up the bench to the exact spot (suspect they use a ruler to measure), tie bands around the bench for god knows what reason, put on a hundred different sleeves and their belt, sit around for 5 mins, then lift one rep for the video. ok I understand if you would like to check your form or want to show off your wonderful top set on social media, but please.. don’t do it every set, every time you are there. 

Might trigger some people here, but a gym is for exercising not your damn tiktok.

Why can’t people just get into the gym, lift weights, and fug off..

One of the main reasons for my switch is also due to the equipment availability as well. The AF I signed up for back then was probably the smallest AF in SG afaik. Every equipment will have to wait and the entire free weights area felt congested. I tahan for a year as the ppl there are friendly and guided me through my workouts, plus that's the only gym in my area and walking distance.

2 years later, a new activesg gym was built also within walking distance and I went to see how the gym facilities over there. In terms of equipment it's quite a drop in but there are many more equipment as compared to AF. Basically quantity over quality ah. 

The final straw for me to switch over was the price. Back then my monthly membership fee was $88, and I paid $80 for the key fob, which is still sitting on my table, which now may seem cheap compared to current rates. But the activesg gym has annual membership of $300 for peak hours and $80 for non peak hours.

Im not talking about amateur calisthenics vs amateur bodybuilders. Im talking about literally “pro” calisthenics with years of training will never ever come close to an amateur bodybuilder. If they’re really that good like what you say, why dont we see them competing in bodybuilding shows? Part of the reason being, the resistance level is a costant throughout for calisthenics because it’s purely body weight and core training. They’re good at controlling their own body weight. Whereas, a bodybuilder uses weights which he can increase over time to create resistance. Read up relative strength vs absolute strength.

You can say, “ohh then a calisthenics athlete could also increase the duration or reps to make it harder” fact is, building muscles dont work this way. Its like how you see someone doing 10 sets of 100 push ups daily will stay as he/she is because theres no change to weight, just an increase in reps and sets which up till a certain point is “junk volume” or reps that have diminishing returns. Read up progressive overload where bodybuilders increase the weights over time and train till near failure to illicit response for the body’s growth. So you say, since its just training till failure, calisthenics people can train till failure too with body weight isnt it? But then again, since there’s no change to weight, or even if they do, there’s only so much they could add (weighted dips compared to a bench press, or bent over barbell row compared to a weighted pull up) because of the limitations due to the execution of the exercise, they have to make up for in reps. Say you do a set of 50 reps on a push up till failure. Are you actually hitting failure because you really hit muscular failure or are you hitting failure due to fatigue from the multiple reps you do? So alot of it is actually junk volume that does no shit to building dense solid muscles. As compared to the gym where you could just pick a set of dumbbells and perform a set of 6 hard reps till failure from the get go and you know you failed at 6 reps because it was heavy from the start with maxmial output. In other words, quality reps. you fatigue out because it was heavy instead of from doing multiple reps on end. Basically, read up RPE. With so much improvement to gym equipment, there’s no way a primitive pair of bars would trump the advantage that modern gym equipment brings. 

And if you still insist that calisthenics people are better, its either
1) Looks are subjective and maybe to you they do look better. But to me, you’re just delusional and have a bad sense of what looks good and dont know what real good looks is. 

2) you’re literally making an unfair comparison between a pro calisthenics athlete who happens to have blessed genetics to an average gym bro. 

3) you’re just coping that you (calisthenics people) cant be on the same level as a bodybuilder if you’re to compare pros vs pros and amateurs vs amateurs. 

And dont give me the nonsense where they could bench just as heavy. If so, find me a calisthenics pro that could bench 3-4 plates for reps.",7,-0.732,Negative

Like I said to the other poste, please learn to differentiate between a bodybuilder and powerlifter. The two are NOT THE SAME.

Bodybuilders don't focus on increasing weights. They actually focus on increasing REPS, similiar to calisthenic athletes. You don't even know the science of muscle-building when you cant even distinguish between type I and II fibre muscles.

>But then again, since there’s no change to weight, or even if they do, there’s only so much they could add (weighted dips compared to a bench press, or bent over barbell row compared to a weighted pull up) because of the limitations due to the execution of the exercise, they have to make up for in reps.

Real calisthenic people are doing stuff like planche, front levers, handstand pushups, muscleups etc. Not stupid basic pullups and dips lol. And these are exercises that takes years to over a decade to master.  Anyone can lift a silly barbell. But 99.999% of people cant do a single calisthenic advance exercise at all.

And for your info, I can tell you for sure anyone who can do more than 10 clean muscle-ups can easily lift up the entire fucking machine max weights on a lateral pulldown machine in the gym. Go follow some calisthenic athletes and you'll realize just how bloody strong they are. They just wander into random gyms and can bench press more than 90% of all the people there. You dont even know about the sport. You're prob the same kind of ignorant person who thinks gymnastics is some girly sport but it's in fact the most strength-intensive sport in the entire Olympics for men.

Bodybuilders dont just use light weights with volume. They aren’t strength focused, but their approach to training is strength training for hypertrophy. Purely strength training like powerlifting is relying more on the central nervous system and their ability to utilise more muscle to do the work. Bodybuilding you could say is like a little bit of both. You dont need lots of size to be strong because strength, like what i said, is more of a central nervous system thing. But more size definitely means more strength. Bro i dont think you really know what you’re talking about. You’re literally “bro science-ing” your way throughout. Yea talk about steroids.

We are not talking specificity here. If you want to compare it that way, you can train pullups and pushup with weights as well. Guess who gets stronger faster? The person doing bodyweight pull ups or the one doing pull ups with weighted plates?

Bigger muscles may not always mean stronger but it is strongly related. You can gain strength without putting on muscle but you cant gain muscle without gaining strength.

Let me spell out to you the biggest problem in calisthenics - scaling. Pushups are extremely hard for beginners but too easy for a well trained athlete. Now, you may argue that there are different push up variants but that argument will simply dismantle your above argument talking about specificity.

Wrong. Just completely wrong. First of all, please define what strength even means? If it means core strength itself, size is NOT the determinant factor. It's your muscle memory, fiber composition and neuromuscular efficiency. Power lifters train Type II muscles more which maximizes their strength. Bodybuilders are fuck-all and don't even specialize in either strength (powerlifters) nor flexibility/performance (calist./gymnastics) which is why they fail at anything actually practical: in strength, endurance and performance tests.

> Like any of your pro calisthenics guys arent on them too.

Yes they aren't? The fuck do they need steroids for LOL. Steroids is for stupid fake aesthetics. Calisthenics dont give a shit about that. They focus on performing their own advanced moves. Steroids also causes stomach bloating which is contradictory to performing calisthenics 

>Like i said, if you still think Calisthenics can ObLIteRaTE a bodybuilder in strength, find me one who can. As mentioned in ny previous comment, look up Kevin Levrone, a very strong pro bodybuilder. I could list out a few names too if you think they aren’t strong. Nick walker, Dorian Yates, Franco Columbo, Arnold (used to compete in weightlifting as well with a bench of 525lbs), Dallas Mcarver. Like i said, find me a cali guy that could bench 3 plates. Mind you some of the regular gym rats could bench 3 plate for reps and they’re not even pros.

Bro just google top calisthenic athletes and see for yourself. All of them still hit the gym periodically and you can see for yourself the sheer amt of weights they lift lol

You clearly don't even know anything about the sport and how insanely hard it is. Just doing a single one arm pullup requires a person to be capable of lifting 85% of his bodyweight and do at least 35 clean pullups",1,0.9927,Positive

My current home gym is siglap cc which does get somewhat crowded at 6pm onwards but before 730pm its still quite alright. Ive also experimented with 2 in tampines; the one at tampines grande is usually not crowded but it is very small with 1 full rack and a smith. Theres one at tampines north cc which does get crowded but u dont really feel the crowd because this gym is really huge. 

In the far east you have af upper changi which is in parc komo condo. This is rather new and not very crowded for now i suspect because its in a condo/landed dense estate and most condo residents have condo gyms. The hdb crowd in that area has loyang point af to go to. 

Also, theres an upcoming AF set to open at Eastwood centre (3 bus stops from tanah merah mrt) in late june to early july.

Maybe tag on an early termination fee that isn't overly outrageous, it's a win-win for both sides.

Note that I say should, not will. I know telcos don't work like this.

How about gyms? You sign a full 1 year package for $20 less a month, if you terminate early you pay back the gym however much you would have paid if you signed on a monthly plan instead of yearly, I.e., $20x N months of used membership. It's not that difficult to math, and the gym doesn't lose anything.

But I cannot see how in this one instance in this post how's it's fair for someone to just break a signed contract over a reason nobody can verify if it's real. You can't possibly not see my point and the far reaching complications it would bring if this was the norm behaviour. Nobody pointed a gun at his head to sign the contract. He made the choice to commit to a long term monthly payment to enjoy a cheaper rate. It's his responsibility to make sure he can keep to it.",1,0.8994,Positive

2. I went for a PT that i found on carousell (there’s a lot of options there), so this is an option that u can consider. However, a lot of them refuse to do sessions at AF cos u r actually not allowed to have PT sessions at AF with non AF trainers. Some of them will suggest to do the PT sessions at activesg gyms, but others, including my trainer, would include gym passes in the PT package

3. Some powerlifting gyms in SG also offer introductory sessions for strength training which would include teaching you how to use machines and basic exercises like squat/bench/deadlift. this is cheaper than PT sessions but its like group classes, not one to one",1,0.8518,Positive

OP, great that you’re looking to get into the gym at your age. Training properly with a good workout split and also proper nutrition/rest for next 6-7 years will set you up for life. These are your peak years for physical training.

Gains aside, working out can absolutely help your mental health. Teenage years can be a tough and emotional time, but keep pushing forward and I can promise that chances are things will get better OR you will become better/stronger at dealing with them.

As for your question, probably your parents need to go with you and sign a consent form and it will be on their credit card

The only issue is typically there is a 12 month contract. So you should sign up only if you confirm you wanna commit. If you are still trying out then go for the ActiveSG for a while first

In addition, when you first join the gym you’ll have to pay an addition $70 (if I recall correctly) for the key fob. 

Anytime Fitness adopts a first come first serve basis, meaning if limit capacity is reached you’ll have to wait for people to exit, before you’re allowed to enter. Although, I’ve personally never encountered this problem before! One good thing about Anytime Fitness is that it’s 24/7 so you can go work out anytime based on your schedule.

Others may disagree, but I highly recommend going to a gym to start instead of doing bodyweight fitness. I found the ""beginner gains"" phase really hooked me on weightlifting, and it can be easier to get those gains when you can easily scale up weights with a wide variety of equipment.

My AF membership finished its locked in period and can cancel anytime, i didnt have to do anything and can continue using like normal. 

For OP, i can only speak for my branch and yours might be more flexible. If the price is low because its due to promo, the membership is non-transferable. Also there’s a camera at every entrance so depending on how hardworking the outlet staff is, they might notice if you bought and are using someone else’s fob. 

If i remember correctly, the referral is 1 or 2 months free. If you’re willing to wait you can look for a brand new outlet opening and enquire about their opening membership, it goes for around $70.

I've also moved my ""residential gym"" to a few different outlets during that time and all I can say is, it's worth it if you can afford it.  


The Crowds and Staff vary from outlet to outlet. It really depends on which one you're planning on visiting frequently. You can always hit them up for a trial session, I think it's just one free day. Wait times don't seem to be very long as ""veterans"" won't hog machines while chilling on their phones. You can always just nudge them to let you know when they are done.  


No one cares how heavy (or light) you lift. Somedays I just use an empty bar. Unless you look like you're going to hurt yourself. High school never ends. No Matter the Financial Barrier. It isn't too far off from ActiveSG.

I'm still paying about 88 a month, currently, their fees are about 95 dollars a month for people who are just joining. (So if you're going about three times a week, it's just shy of 8 dollars per Entry)

You can probably wait for the ""New Year, New Me"" Promotions, but won't really reduce the monthly price. Also, on the day you do decide to sign up, get some random member to ""refer"" you. They will get a month for free.

I didn't continue after my contract ended a few months ago. I am still paying for my wife's AF membership. I was and am paying around $95 per member per month.

When I was a member, I used to go to the gym 5-6 times a week. Spending anything from 1-2 hours each time there but only for the weights and the cardio machines. My wife only attends the 'free' yoga/zumba/orwhatyouhave lessons at most 4 times a month. These lessons have to be booked via an app and apparently they are very popular. It is quite often that she does not get a slot to attend. 

The best thing about AF is that you can gym-hop 24/7. The newer ones are generally quite nice, like  the one at The Woodgrove, Woodlands but there are some AF gyms that show their age. AF gyms vary quite widely in size and equipment. If you travel, you can try AF gyms around the world. Some are tiny. The only one I have tried outside Singapore is the one at Austin Heights, JB. I am not sure if this worldwide AF gym access is really useful because every hotel I stay in my travels usually have a gym facility. Also not all countries have AF gyms, like Vietnam, currently.

The one nearest to me is the one at Punggol Oasis. Relatively new, cozy, the punching bag is off-limits after late hours, the staff are very friendly but it lacks a proper lats pulldown or lats row machine IMHO.

The crowd levels vary throughout the day and it really depends on your specific outlet. Generally speaking, I think the crowd levels are highest during weekdays in the evenings. Weekends are sometimes oddly empty.

If aircon is important to you, you might want to note that in all the branches I have been to at unearthly hours, the aircon is either not fully on, or at all. It is one of the few things about AF that I do not like.

You can deadlift in AF. And I think no one cares about how you do your workout as long as you are not posing a danger to other people.

Although I am not longer an AF member, I am thankful that AF was the one thing that got me working out regularly now. My wife made me sign up and for the first 5-6 months, I didn't even use the fob. One of the staff called me up, checked up on me and eventually got me going and hooked.

If money is not a factor, I prefer AF over ActiveSg. It seems like ActiveSg is always packed even during office hours. I think ActiveSg has a larger student member population who are free in the morning/afternoons.

AF is great if you like to workout at weird hours so you can have the gym mostly to yourself.

Another gym I can recommend is SAFRA's Energyone, especially if the Daylighter single club membership plan works for you. It is like $385.20 for 6 months.",2,0.9971,Positive

If you get a cheap gym but location sucks for your schedule, then eventually you will just not want to go.

So, choose the one nearest to your house or workplace. This makes it easier to fit into your schedule.

If budget is a concern, can consider ActiveSG, especially since you are a beginner so you may want to first figure out what kind of a gym user you are:

1. Treadmill bunny: mainly using treadmill
2. Power lifter: mainly using squat rack and bench press
3. Free weights only: mainly using free weights
4. Machine only : mainly using machines
5. Atas gym user: mainly using the facilities like swimming pool, salt room, ice room, etc and need services like no need  bring clothes or socks

Then, find the gym that makes most sense to you. For eg. If you are a treadmill bunny, look for gyms with more treadmills . If you are power lifter, check how many squat racks and olympic barbells they have. If you are free weights only, check how big is the free weights area and selection of weights (kettlebell, barbell, etc). If you are machine only, check how big is the machine area and how many people using. If you are the atas gym user then you need to see if the gym offers the services you want.",1,0.9793,Positive

ActiveSG is a shitshow pretty much, unless you are budget strapped. I've been in VA for about 10 months in, consistently going, from 2 times a week to now maybe 5-6times a week and can see significant progress in my fitness.

Things I looked out for -   
(1) Location (less so of being near me) but near MRT station, best if its sheltered so if it rains, I still go and don't even need an umbrella. Reasonably close to either home or office (in this case it was office).  
(2) Opening hours - needs to be open when I want to go to the gym, usually in the evening, so if it closes at 5pm on the weekends, it doesn't work.  
(3) Accessibility to variety of classes - I initially did more yoga/HIIT but that didn't improve my physique much, then I started strength training which helped considerably, but I also hit a point where I started to notice the importance of functional training and flexibility - where classes in yoga/pilates helps if its covered in your membership.  
(4) Most importantly CROWD - non-peak for VA generally has been quite good, so with the exception of noon and between 6-8pm on a weekday, the crowd is usually ok, ie. don't have to wait for machines, or have sufficient machines (especially squat racks, cable machines, threadmill etc.)  
(5) Space - I just cannot stand how closely each machine is at some of the smaller gyms so those are out for me.  
(6) Toilets/Cleanliness - Unfortunately, some gym users are just not too clean, I'm sorry but its usually the mainland chinese people. ie. throwing their clothes all over the place. But VA generally have a frequent cleaning cycle so its usually still ok.  
(7) Perks - Gym clothes if I forget to bring mine, towels and the body comp scan thing.  
(8) PTs/Trainers are generally pleasant to deal with, not their client and you can ask them to teach how to use certain machines etc. Hit and miss here, so you need to find a good one.  
(9) Members - Generally quite diverse members too by gender and age groups, so you don't feel too awkward starting as a beginner. The classes have a crazy following though, its a little daunting.  
(10) Near MBS/trail run tracks - This is a little more niche for me as I was prepping for marathons, and I needed routes for me to run 5/10/16km++  
(11) Tailored training for specific milestones/events, If you do trialathons etc. there's a indoor pool. If you do Hyrox, there's a indoor hyrox circuit area.  
(12) Access to mall/specific F&B - Boost/Daily cut for my quick bites/protein drinks

Albeit overall still satisfied with them so far, I am due for renewal soon but haven't found another place thats comparable yet. Overall, paying about 270-280 per month? but I go at least 20-25 times a month so its actually not that expensive. I think one point rest of the redditors mentioned about convenience being important, I actually found it easier to build an habit because its NOT convenient, and having to take an hour mrt ride down on a weekend to go to the gym, really shocked my system and routine that I feel weird actually not going down.",1,0.9903,Positive

1. How much is the membership fee per month? Are there any extra costs upon registration? I found online that it is $90 onwards and heard that it may vary from branch to branch so just wanted to seek more clarification.

2. How is the equipment at the gyms? Understand that it varies a lot, but what about in general? Will be going to the branches in the Central e.g. Serangoon, Boon Keng and East (Loyang Point, Tampines). Would be doing free weights mostly.

3. How good are their classes? Are they popular among the members and around which age group do the participants tend to be in?

didn’t join any of the gyms (anytime fitness, fitness first, etc) because i have zero idea how to use any of the equipment. i also dont know how to plan workout routines effectively. feel like i would just end up using the treadmill. 

used to be on classpass but disliked how inflexible they are when it comes to cancellations. the classes that i like tend to fill up too quickly since the studios will prioritise their own members first. credits kept rolling over and i finally decided to cancel. 

very apprehensively signed up for bft trial and ended up staying on the permanent package. i find it very beginner friendly! for strength classes, they have lighter weight options. i’ve used those many times without feeling judged. the coaches or other members might encourage you to go heavier if they think you’re up for it, but no pressure or judgment. for the cardio classes, you can go at your own pace also. i’ve met many friendly members who helped me, encouraged me, even though we were complete strangers. i also like that they plan out the programs so i don’t have to think, just show up and do as i am told.

using a fancier machine does not make an exercise any more effective. 

the problem seems to be your mind-muscle connection and that your form is not right, thus you're not activating the right muscles that you're trying to.

if you feel it in the back, your posture or form may not be right. you may be subconsciously arching your lower back and rounding your pelvis. try doing leg raises lying on the ground or a mat while practicing to engage the right muscles.

But I always notice that I cannot activate my abs correctly, my back muscles always end up compensating for my abs, regardless of how slow I do it. Then I saw an influencer I follow who has crazy abs (he wasn't advertising the product, he was just showing his routine), and I saw that he was using something called the ""Ab Coaster"". Upon reading further on it, it is a machine which fixes my exact concern, wrong muscle activation.

My question is, are there any gyms with the Ab Coaster Machine?

The point of your core is to stablise your body, the more you actually use it as part of other compound movements of your body the better.

If you're just going for the look, you might want to adjust your diet and learn more about lighting and shadow in photography instead.

If you don't believe me you can look up on the science behind this yourself. I'm confident that many other people with amazing abs online don't use 'captain chairs' because it doesn't engage the obliques at all.",2,0.9223,Positive

15kfpvn,askSingapore,iamabigbluebox,7/8/2023 17:32,"Gym Closed, is Money Paid for Membership as Good as Gone?","Hi everyone,  was hoping to get some advice regarding if there is any possible recourse if for boutique (i.e. single outlet) gyms that have closed.

I signed a two year package with a gym and have used about 25ish% of my membership duration (5ish months), but they have seemingly closed due to legal issues (i'm assuming it has to do with them moving their PT gym out and cancelling the lease, which resulted in them forfeiting the commercial gym as well).

On the social media, they have stated that they are looking for buyers to take over the gym and to extend the membership of the existing members, but when I tried to go to the building to check, the security has essentially informed me that they have essentially closed for good as the floor has been taken over by another business. From what I see, the owner(s) have just started a new gym in Thailand, and their Singapore PT gym is running as per usual. 

I tried to ask for a refund on the gym's Instagram, but they haven't read/replied. I was wondering if anyone thinks if there's a way to get back some money (e.g. small claims tribunal), or if it is honestly as good as a lost cause.

Will greatly appreciate any advice on this, thank you!

EDIT: Hey everyone, thank you all so much for your responses! I really do appreciate the imput and the different perspectives shared. I think I'll try to give a little more context/some responses regarding some of the comments.

I basically signed for this gym because it's very close to my workplace/easy to access via public transport from my house, and it was open 24/7. I also understand that there are cheaper options, but there was a lot of great equipment (like i have genuinely never seen or been to a better equipped gym before), and the per month cost for the two year membership was cheaper than Anytime Fitness.

Again, i don't actually think it's a financial issue because they were bringing in brand new equipment and had upgraded shower facilities just prior to the sudden closure, and i strongly suspect it has to do with the tenancy agreement, but this is all speculation on my end.

While the page claims they are still sourcing for buyers to take over, my main concerns are that:
1. I'll be in limbo till there's a buyer and I have no idea how long that will take.
2. There is no guarantee that the gym will still be in a similar location. 

While I do emphatise with the owners to an extent, it really does suck to be in limbo and have my fitness progress halted because of this, especially since this was basically my brithday treat to myself, but what can you do i guess. I'll do a little more research on my end and think it over a little more before i decide on my next steps.

15kfpvn,askSingapore,iamabigbluebox,7/8/2023 17:32,"Gym Closed, is Money Paid for Membership as Good as Gone?","Hi everyone,  was hoping to get some advice regarding if there is any possible recourse if for boutique (i.e. single outlet) gyms that have closed.

I signed a two year package with a gym and have used about 25ish% of my membership duration (5ish months), but they have seemingly closed due to legal issues (i'm assuming it has to do with them moving their PT gym out and cancelling the lease, which resulted in them forfeiting the commercial gym as well).

On the social media, they have stated that they are looking for buyers to take over the gym and to extend the membership of the existing members, but when I tried to go to the building to check, the security has essentially informed me that they have essentially closed for good as the floor has been taken over by another business. From what I see, the owner(s) have just started a new gym in Thailand, and their Singapore PT gym is running as per usual. 

I tried to ask for a refund on the gym's Instagram, but they haven't read/replied. I was wondering if anyone thinks if there's a way to get back some money (e.g. small claims tribunal), or if it is honestly as good as a lost cause.

Will greatly appreciate any advice on this, thank you!

EDIT: Hey everyone, thank you all so much for your responses! I really do appreciate the imput and the different perspectives shared. I think I'll try to give a little more context/some responses regarding some of the comments.

I basically signed for this gym because it's very close to my workplace/easy to access via public transport from my house, and it was open 24/7. I also understand that there are cheaper options, but there was a lot of great equipment (like i have genuinely never seen or been to a better equipped gym before), and the per month cost for the two year membership was cheaper than Anytime Fitness.

Again, i don't actually think it's a financial issue because they were bringing in brand new equipment and had upgraded shower facilities just prior to the sudden closure, and i strongly suspect it has to do with the tenancy agreement, but this is all speculation on my end.

While the page claims they are still sourcing for buyers to take over, my main concerns are that:
1. I'll be in limbo till there's a buyer and I have no idea how long that will take.
2. There is no guarantee that the gym will still be in a similar location. 

While I do emphatise with the owners to an extent, it really does suck to be in limbo and have my fitness progress halted because of this, especially since this was basically my brithday treat to myself, but what can you do i guess. I'll do a little more research on my end and think it over a little more before i decide on my next steps.

Sure its my fault for not properly reading the T&Cs, but the fact that they hid that in their fine line is scummy.

Also they will charge your $100 admin fee like OP mentioned if you go to the newer ones, because now they are forcing you to use the card to go through their gantry. They are saving the cost by reducing admin staff headcount, but instead of passing the savings down to their long-time customer, they decide to double down and also charge them for this stupid card.

I signed a two year package with a gym and have used about 25ish% of my membership duration (5ish months), but they have seemingly closed due to legal issues (i'm assuming it has to do with them moving their PT gym out and cancelling the lease, which resulted in them forfeiting the commercial gym as well).

On the social media, they have stated that they are looking for buyers to take over the gym and to extend the membership of the existing members, but when I tried to go to the building to check, the security has essentially informed me that they have essentially closed for good as the floor has been taken over by another business. From what I see, the owner(s) have just started a new gym in Thailand, and their Singapore PT gym is running as per usual. 

I tried to ask for a refund on the gym's Instagram, but they haven't read/replied. I was wondering if anyone thinks if there's a way to get back some money (e.g. small claims tribunal), or if it is honestly as good as a lost cause.

Will greatly appreciate any advice on this, thank you!

EDIT: Hey everyone, thank you all so much for your responses! I really do appreciate the imput and the different perspectives shared. I think I'll try to give a little more context/some responses regarding some of the comments.

I basically signed for this gym because it's very close to my workplace/easy to access via public transport from my house, and it was open 24/7. I also understand that there are cheaper options, but there was a lot of great equipment (like i have genuinely never seen or been to a better equipped gym before), and the per month cost for the two year membership was cheaper than Anytime Fitness.

Again, i don't actually think it's a financial issue because they were bringing in brand new equipment and had upgraded shower facilities just prior to the sudden closure, and i strongly suspect it has to do with the tenancy agreement, but this is all speculation on my end.

While the page claims they are still sourcing for buyers to take over, my main concerns are that:
1. I'll be in limbo till there's a buyer and I have no idea how long that will take.
2. There is no guarantee that the gym will still be in a similar location. 

While I do emphatise with the owners to an extent, it really does suck to be in limbo and have my fitness progress halted because of this, especially since this was basically my brithday treat to myself, but what can you do i guess. I'll do a little more research on my end and think it over a little more before i decide on my next steps.

I really like the 24 hour aspect because *usually* I don’t have to queue/wait for equipment which means it’s more flexible around my other commitments.

But recently, I noticed the place is getting more popular at night. I don’t care if I sound condescending saying this but many of these newcomers don’t seem that sincere in using the place.

Which means they literally just come in, find some equipment to sit on and just browse social media for an hour while doing a few reps here and there. It’s annoying.

I changed gyms for this very reason because I got fed up not being able to do what I want to do and get out.

No need readjust height. If you're using the rack and adjusting height, you can leave it like that for the next person to adjust (since you won't know their height). As long as you rack/return the weights to their original place, people will be happy. Usually can tell by observing what others do.

Enjoy ur gym! Is quite fun imo and good way to destress/maintain general discipline. Most people will never bother you. If you want to share equipment, by all means feel free to ask.

For cardio the exercise bikes seat can also be adjusted. You don't need to adjust back because you don't know the next person's needs.

With more outlets popping up, you can just look for one, get the early bird promo, and then switch to a nearer one after a month.

So some rules are as follows:
Don't hog the weights, machines, blah blah. Try to not use your phone when on the bench wherever itself.
I believe all AFs have sanitising sprays and those paper towels to wipe off after use. You can bring a towel, but it'd be encouraged to use one of the wiping stuff after.
Don't do exercises right infront of the weight racks.
You can always ask to share and after a while, you will start to see hand signs and you will understand them. This is especially if you or the other person is plugged in.

On your first day or whatnot, the trainer/staff might show you around or you can even ask them. Having been to many, 90% of them are friendly and will assist you. They don't push as much for packages. Shout out to tanjong Katong AF, they good.

most information are usually one google away, but must rmb to fact check across multiple sources to make sure u dont absorp bs.

youtubers to not listen to: athlean-x (jeff caveliere), that guy is full of bs.

as for gyms i suggest activesg hehe, cheap + free $100. 

not a personal trainer but i think i myself can give u a rough idea of what you should do;

since ur overweight, u wanna be on a calorie deficit, meaning consume lesser calories than you need. (200-300 lesser, but pls dont starve urself, ur body needs nutrition to function)

do cardio, burn fats (but i recommend doing cardio after ur gym sessions bcos doing cardio before can wear u out and make ur gym sessions suck)

eat clean to build muscle, if u wanna grow muscles u must have adequate protein intake (~1.8g/kg bodyweight). but if ur alr overweight, u should eat food thats high in protein but low in overall calories, to well, simply build muscle and lose fats

ur the totally opposite of me haha, im underweight and skinny heheh",2,0.9486,Positive

I've been fairly inactive for quite a while and it shows, physically. 😅 I've had a membership at True Fitness a year back, but barely used it (poor discipline) and also cancelled due to the virus along with certain circumstances which made me rethink if the fees are worth it.

I'm considering starting a membership with either Anytime Fitness / Fitness First due to proximity, but am torn. The AF that's convenient for me seems to have a nicer crowd, and great flexibility due to no bookings needed and 24/7 (nearly). However, the facility seems pretty shoddy and the place is always packed, along with there being no restrictions for time makes me wonder if I'd be able to do what I want to do. The FF that I toured seemed to have the typical gym-snob crowd, with bookings required, slightly more expensive fees. But it does seem less crowded, more spacious, and better equipment.

Also, if any kind soul is considering to respond, I am also interested in paying for either of the gym's PT sessions, but have zero experience with any of these things. Would totally appreciate any suggestions or things to look out for while I make this decision!

Edit: I've also tried out the ActiveSG community gym. I like that it's pay per use but the difficulty in booking and crowd isn't something I can deal with. And also the Gym Pod but holy it's not cheap at all.

Get AF if you can go off peak hours (ie not crowded) and you're ok with self routine without machines (mostly weights).

Get FF if you want showers, towels and PT attire provided and want to use a wider variety of machines with more weights.

As for trainers, FF has a team of trainers that you can choose from but afaik AF only has like 1-2 which comes on different days. Can't say much about AF but FF""s trainers and their training are pretty decent",3,0.9753,Positive

I've been fairly inactive for quite a while and it shows, physically. 😅 I've had a membership at True Fitness a year back, but barely used it (poor discipline) and also cancelled due to the virus along with certain circumstances which made me rethink if the fees are worth it.

I'm considering starting a membership with either Anytime Fitness / Fitness First due to proximity, but am torn. The AF that's convenient for me seems to have a nicer crowd, and great flexibility due to no bookings needed and 24/7 (nearly). However, the facility seems pretty shoddy and the place is always packed, along with there being no restrictions for time makes me wonder if I'd be able to do what I want to do. The FF that I toured seemed to have the typical gym-snob crowd, with bookings required, slightly more expensive fees. But it does seem less crowded, more spacious, and better equipment.

Also, if any kind soul is considering to respond, I am also interested in paying for either of the gym's PT sessions, but have zero experience with any of these things. Would totally appreciate any suggestions or things to look out for while I make this decision!

Edit: I've also tried out the ActiveSG community gym. I like that it's pay per use but the difficulty in booking and crowd isn't something I can deal with. And also the Gym Pod but holy it's not cheap at all.

I think you brought up a good point about the longevity and operations of some gyms given the current covid-19 climate. I previously purchased my own set of weights during the first circuit breaker last year, so I suppose I do have a back up plan. 
I prefer to workout at the gym as I’m not limited by space constraints as I’m when I’m home.
