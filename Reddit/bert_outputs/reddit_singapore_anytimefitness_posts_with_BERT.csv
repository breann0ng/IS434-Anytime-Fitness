ejbtoo,singapore,yoongisteak,3/1/2020 14:57,Advice Needed: Anytime Fitness vs ActiveSG?,"Am looking for a gym with monthly fee below $100 and without having to pay full amount upfront – am currently considering between these two due to price and proximity to work (Alexandra) and home (Potong Pasir). For context, I'm also a (female) gym newbie and discipline/getting into routine is quite important for me at this stage – I do a mix of both cardio and strength training on the machines. 

The AF outlet near my place is running a 10% promo for $85.50/mth but I will be locked down for 18 months, vs. $75 for 12 months for the another AF outlet opening near work, but downside is it only opens in March. The opening rate is transferrable upon renewal (or so they say).

ActiveSG I know is a cheap alternative, but the heartland areas are not as convenient for me to get to from home or work, and I heard it gets really crowded during peak hours (after work) which is the only time I have available to workout. 

Should I just suck it up and sign up with the AF near my place for an extra $10.50 a month + additional 6 months commitment, or go with the lower opening AF fee + use ActiveSG in the meantime until March? Any advice? 

**P.S.** Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post in, or if there's a more fitness-specific one, but I thought I'd try my luck.

53m82n,singapore,uMakeMeWet,20/9/2016 15:10,Cost efficient gyms in Bedok?,"Disclaimer: I did do some research on here/Google beforehand, but I felt that I could not make a wise decision yet with no experience so here I am. My post is rather long and detailed; gist of it is in TLDR.

Some background info: I'm a soon to be 16yo student. Minimal experience with weightlifting, but back in Sec 2+3 I did some calisthenics, not sure exactly why I stopped. I'm looking to get back 'into shape', (pullup game weak af now), after exams end (heng ah no Os except for HCL). Plan to workout daily/alternate days til school reopens in Jan 17, then see how busy JC life is.

As you can partially tell from the title, what I am looking out for are the following:

-Located in Bedok area. I live at Bedok Reservoir (600+). Not necessarily the street name must have Bedok, but ideally travel time by bus/mrt to be below 30min.

-Reasonable combination of cost+quality. I dont want my money (read: my parents) to be thrown away for some atas gym membership, but sure as hell do not want to end up lifting a barbell with 2 rocks on the side. An exaggeration, but you get my point. Beyond my common sense I don't have much knowledge about pricing, so I definitely could use some tips here.

-Crowdedness. I read on here about some gyms being crowded and needing to queue. Idm if say need to wait for 1 person finish their set, but I'm not keen on queuing to enter the gym. I probably would be working out in the morning from 9+ or 10, or 3/4/5pm when hols haven't start. Again, input from frequent gym goers in relevant location gladly welcome.

-Equipment wise, nth too fancy. Main workout comprises of free weights. I will probably be doing rather standard stuff: deadlift, squat, bench press more or less confirmed, maybe some curls or shoulder raise etc with dumbell, lat pulldown/ pullups and treadmill cos 2.4 game weak af. I don't think there is much to be concerned about here.

Currently, the appealing choices are Gymboxx Bedok Reservoir/Bedok Point, or AnytimeFitness Bedok. I've looked at ActiveSG too, but outlet at Bedok seems less convenient acess wise. Gymboxx is more ex I noticed, at like $50 or $60 /month IIRC, for 3 months. But, what got my attention was a ripoff $30 admin fee wtf. It seems that the Bedok Point outlet would also be rather crowded, as much as it is spacious and well equipped. Otherwise it seems good. 

AnytimeFitness on first look the purple interior gave my eyes cancer and looked real small, but apparently the website claim 3k sq ft on 2 floors so maybe not that bad. Apparently dirt cheap membership, but advice on quality/availability of equipment and crowdedness needed.

TLDR: Looking at Gymboxx Bedok Reservoir/Bedok Point or Anytime Fitness Bedok to go to during hols. Any advice, esp those related to aforementioned outlets welcome :)",3,1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/53m82n/cost_efficient_gyms_in_bedok/,LABEL_0,0.462677001953125,negative

1ncqsve,SingaporeFitness,Gloomyuser,10/9/2025 2:26,Anytime Fitness Singapore Overcharged me,"
Hi all, I need advice on an issue with Anytime Fitness.

[17 Mar] Signed up at a branch near my house. Paid $898 upfront for what I was told was a 12-month membership (with discounts).

Early Jun: Transferred to a branch near my workplace.

[1 Sep]: Found an extra $98 deduction from my bank, no invoice or email.

[2 Sep]: Contacted both branches. Both pushed me to the other.

Workplace branch: said my “initial term ends 28/03/2026” and I’m on a monthly contract.

Original branch: never reached out despite being told they would by the workplace branch.

[6 Sep]: Followed up with the original branch.

[7 Sep]: They claimed the money i paid (did not specify the amount) was only covered until Aug 2025, and I’ll be charged monthly from Sep 2025.

This doesn’t make sense because:

I was told $898 was for 12 full months (from Mar 2025).

They started charging me again in Sep 2025, only 5 months in.

Monthly membership is usually $80–100, so the numbers don’t add up.

Despite asking twice, I still haven’t received an invoice/record of my $898 payment.

Has anyone faced something similar with Anytime Fitness? What’s the best way to get this resolved?

Tldr: I paid for a 12 month membership and anytime fitness charged me even before the 12 month membership ended and is trying to push responsibilites now.",75,3,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeFitness/comments/1ncqsve/anytime_fitness_singapore_overcharged_me/,LABEL_0,0.6921879053115845,negative

1h33dqr,askSingapore,JovSkywalker_66,30/11/2024 11:22,Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60,"

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to do😭. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Update: They called me and said after further investigation, they decided to waiver the fee and all this happened was due to a new staff's inexperience.🫠",789,23,193,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1h33dqr/anytime_fitness_wants_me_to_pay_60/,LABEL_0,0.5644809603691101,negative

1kuy0kl,askSingapore,RedAutumFall,25/5/2025 16:51,"Can't decide whether to get gym membership. Which would you choose if you were me (E.g. active sg, anytime fitness)","So I want to get into fitness, but knowing myself I dont have the discipline to do it. However, money is a very strong motivation for me so if I pay for something most of the time I'll commit to it, even if its something I hate. 

Hence I been thinking of getting a gym membership. I have several options. 

5 mins walk from my house is Anytime fitness.

Anytime fitness has a ongoing promo currently at $80/ month, with free fob and registration. My issue with it is its a lock in of 15 months.  And for someone who has never gymed, 15 months is a very very scary commitment. Though looking around, this is probably one of the best rates around. I love that it has a pool and is available 24/7. There are also free classes I can join.  Though the crowd does kind of scare me.

Snap fitness and amore fitness are within 10 mins walk but both more expensive, with amore fitness being the most expensive, so I havent really explored them. 

I do have HTNS membership, so I can alternatively join the gym membership at Fitness Workz, which would be around $50 a month for 12 months or $9 per entry. However, the nearest fitness workz is 35mins from my house. I dont see myself going very often just because of the distance though I may force myself to go if I pay the money.  

Alternatively I could go to the active sg gym, nearest of which is a 15min walk away and only costs like $2 per entry. 

And last but not least, my office has a free gym. My issue with it is that my office is 1.5h away from my house. So I never ever use it. By the time I finish my work its usually around 7pm and I'm just rushing home so I can hopefully get back by 8.30pm to have dinner. I dont really want to be stuck in office for another long hour even if its the gym instead. And I don't have the energy to get up earlier to go to work because I already wake up at 6.30am to reach office in time.

But that being said, its free, and there's barely a crowd because no one wants to stay back after office hours to gym.  (Ive walked passed the gym for an entire year telling myself I should start but I can just never bring myself to stay back after work to gym)

Its also really scary to gym with my colleagues because I have no idea where to start and I dont want to look like an idiot in front of them. Especially as some of them are my senior management. Ill die of embarrassment if I did something wrong and they are around to see it.

So I really dont know what I should choose. 

Should I go for active sg? Anytime fitness? Fitness Workz? Or just hit the gym in my office?

Or should I just not gym at all and stick to swimming for free at Safra and HTNS pools instead of hitting the gym as my way of exercising?

Because I really dont know how to gym and I dont have anyone to gym with me either.... dont want to end up hurting myself and causing long term injuries instead.",36,6,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1kuy0kl/cant_decide_whether_to_get_gym_membership_which/,LABEL_1,0.45002874732017517,neutral

Cut to now, I am going to another gym that’s provided to me for free and hence I’m again trying to cancel my membership with anytime fitness. 

However, they are asking me to pay them a month just to cancel my account. I will not be using their gyms at all nor do I want to. It’s purely paying them just to cancel my account. They argue that they are unable to cancel a suspended account.

I’ve pulled out my contract with them and it doesn’t state that a suspended account cannot be cancelled. My account also fulfils the other listed requirements to be cancelled too.

Of course I do not want to give them a single cent just to stop my membership so I have been communicating with the gym. However it’s not going anywhere. 

I’m thinking about serving them a SCT just to pressure them to cancel my membership and also report them to CASE though I am a bit unsure of how much help CASE can actually do here. I’ve been advised by a friend who studied business laws before to just cancel my card and if they send debt collectors, I can get SCT to dismiss the unfair debt anyways.

A friend of mine is thinking of joining AF. I am an existing member myself. They’ve done well to modernize gym access options, to include phone access via Apple Wallet now. For existing gym members that’s good as we don’t have to bring our keyfobs around. Needless to say, it doesn’t cost money to use your phone. 

For new-joiners, it’s an absolute shitshow because you’re still required to pay $95 one-time for a keyfob even if you have no intention to use it at all. 

They’re not allowing people to opt out of this fee at sign-up. Now they’re twisting shit up and renaming it to an “access fee” where you pay $95 to have access rights to the gym. Aren’t we already paying $$ monthly to ACCESS the gym?

Also, it doesn’t make sense for each member to fork out an additional $95 one-time solely for a door-access system, but they’re positioning it as such. If their door-access system is so costly and high-tech (for what?) then I guess this would be an entirely different conversation. 

If a small low-experience company had such a payment model that didn’t make sense, we won’t pay and we’d probably understand. For someone as established as AF to be positioning their payment model in this ridiculous way still, after so many years in operation - that’s just beyond embarrassing.

I’ll save you the “if you don’t like, don’t pay” because that’s exactly what we’re doing :)

I’m definitely a rookie so I don’t need too heavy weights (for now). Bench, squat, leg press, dumbbells and barbell should be enough for me. Nothing fancy. My questions are:

1) Is Anytime Fitness worth the upgrade over ActiveSG Gym (Woodlands)?

Currently, I'm using ActiveSG but I've found myself to be sick and tired of all the machines, racks, benches being filled within 5 minutes of the session starting, ActiveSG uses a slot booking system if you don't know and its becoming tiring having to get my workout done in such an overcrowded environment, I've had to skip the lifts on my program multiple times now as well.I'm eyeing the Anytime Fitness facility in Toa Payoh where I live rn, to anyone who uses Anytime Fitness (whichever location you use also fine, doesnt have to be tpy), could you tell me how it's like? How crowded/empty on average is the gym you usually go to? Can you just walk in and begin your workout or do you have to use a similar booking system as well?

According to the website, it states that the membership varies from different outlets, and that you will have wait for 30 days before you can access gyms other than the one you applied the membership.

So, does that mean I can just apply membership at a more isolated gym at a cheaper price, wait for the 30 days, then access the more atas gyms in the city area? 

Or can someone clarify that the membership fees actually doesn't really vary much from each gym? And that they are all relatively the same price?

24/7 Fitness is close to me too, and I’ve heard they’re more suited for lifting.

They charge about $50+ a month, compared to around $90+ for AF and 24/7, though there’s a $50 initiation fee. 24/7 doesn’t have any additional fees.

Basically, any combination of more than one individual intent on deadlifting, squatting or benching will drastically increase waiting times for the others.

From my personal experience Gymboxx is way more suited for powerlifters, not to mention much cheaper too (88/mth in AF compared to \~60/mth for Gymboxx).

I signed a two year package with a gym and have used about 25ish% of my membership duration (5ish months), but they have seemingly closed due to legal issues (i'm assuming it has to do with them moving their PT gym out and cancelling the lease, which resulted in them forfeiting the commercial gym as well).

On the social media, they have stated that they are looking for buyers to take over the gym and to extend the membership of the existing members, but when I tried to go to the building to check, the security has essentially informed me that they have essentially closed for good as the floor has been taken over by another business. From what I see, the owner(s) have just started a new gym in Thailand, and their Singapore PT gym is running as per usual. 

I tried to ask for a refund on the gym's Instagram, but they haven't read/replied. I was wondering if anyone thinks if there's a way to get back some money (e.g. small claims tribunal), or if it is honestly as good as a lost cause.

Will greatly appreciate any advice on this, thank you!

EDIT: Hey everyone, thank you all so much for your responses! I really do appreciate the imput and the different perspectives shared. I think I'll try to give a little more context/some responses regarding some of the comments.

I basically signed for this gym because it's very close to my workplace/easy to access via public transport from my house, and it was open 24/7. I also understand that there are cheaper options, but there was a lot of great equipment (like i have genuinely never seen or been to a better equipped gym before), and the per month cost for the two year membership was cheaper than Anytime Fitness.

Again, i don't actually think it's a financial issue because they were bringing in brand new equipment and had upgraded shower facilities just prior to the sudden closure, and i strongly suspect it has to do with the tenancy agreement, but this is all speculation on my end.

While the page claims they are still sourcing for buyers to take over, my main concerns are that:
1. I'll be in limbo till there's a buyer and I have no idea how long that will take.
2. There is no guarantee that the gym will still be in a similar location. 

While I do emphatise with the owners to an extent, it really does suck to be in limbo and have my fitness progress halted because of this, especially since this was basically my brithday treat to myself, but what can you do i guess. I'll do a little more research on my end and think it over a little more before i decide on my next steps.

sp2jmd,askSingapore,sg-lady,10/2/2022 17:23,Hitting the gym and subscriptions,"&#x200B;

I've been fairly inactive for quite a while and it shows, physically. 😅 I've had a membership at True Fitness a year back, but barely used it (poor discipline) and also cancelled due to the virus along with certain circumstances which made me rethink if the fees are worth it.

I'm considering starting a membership with either Anytime Fitness / Fitness First due to proximity, but am torn. The AF that's convenient for me seems to have a nicer crowd, and great flexibility due to no bookings needed and 24/7 (nearly). However, the facility seems pretty shoddy and the place is always packed, along with there being no restrictions for time makes me wonder if I'd be able to do what I want to do. The FF that I toured seemed to have the typical gym-snob crowd, with bookings required, slightly more expensive fees. But it does seem less crowded, more spacious, and better equipment.

Also, if any kind soul is considering to respond, I am also interested in paying for either of the gym's PT sessions, but have zero experience with any of these things. Would totally appreciate any suggestions or things to look out for while I make this decision!

Edit: I've also tried out the ActiveSG community gym. I like that it's pay per use but the difficulty in booking and crowd isn't something I can deal with. And also the Gym Pod but holy it's not cheap at all.

So I’m heading overseas for uni after i ORD. But since I have around half a year and I’m thinking of getting a gym membership (currently using the one inside my camp). Do you guys have any recommendations?
Not a fan of active sg because of… um… [reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/k3xmdd/activesg_gym_starterpack/), but still open to other gyms, haha. 

Thanks in advance for your help

wa7wj5,askSingapore,Hayleymyzee,28/7/2022 19:54,Personal Trainer experience?,"After a 15 year hiatus, i decided to hit back the gym. Now being much older, i have decided to engage a personal trainer (for a start at least) so that i do not over load and injure myself and also to get my form right before i auto pilot through a 3 to 5 day split routine.

I’ve checked out a few gyms around me and felt that the Safra EnergyOne gym was really reasonably priced (half the price), well equipped and spacious enough compared to the smaller Anytime Fitness or Gymboxx setup which seems pretty cramped to me.

Their Personal Trainer packages are pretty affordable as well at $535 for 10 sessions.

Just wondering if anyone has experience with EnergyOne’s PT? 

Not sure what to expect compared to maybe using a PT from a privately operated gym. 

Any comments or sharing of experience much appreciated 😊",3,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/wa7wj5/personal_trainer_experience/,LABEL_2,0.7917296290397644,positive

I mainly use the gym for weights. I also appreciate it when the gym has classes too, such as HIIT and yoga.

I have visited some anytime fitness outlets but my experiences weren’t that positive (e.g., limited weightlifting equipment and poorly maintained machines).

I would love to hear your recommendations and experiences at other gyms! 
It would be good to know if the gyms operate on a booking system and how it is like right now (e.g., limited slots for gym floor/ classes to book).

F.Y.I, I’m a female, so I’m also interested to hear about Amore fitness.
