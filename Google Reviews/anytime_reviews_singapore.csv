Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,In2rovert Life,5,"Visited tons of AF Worldwide and this is one of the nicest gyms in one the best locations (Clarke Quay) in an old shop house/warehouse/club on the 2nd floor.

Good amount of equipment and even a dual sided power squat rack

(allows 2 people to squat on both ends at the same time).
The usual weight selection and plated strength machines, treadmills & machines for cardio.
Only thing missing is a lateral raise machine and I would stay in this gym forever.

They even have a small floor area above overlooking the gym with a rope workout, a crossfit rope machine, or for you to do any workout on the usual comfy purple AF mats.

Large area with rafters, plenty of showers (men's had 2 toilet stalls).

After you're done. NTUC Finest is nearby to grab something, and CQ/Fort Canning MRT are nearby.

Or if you want to end your workout with cardio, Fort Canning Park is just across the Street.

Prime location and one of my favourite AFs in Singapore.
Ps: (their gym soundtrack reminded me of my clubbing days)",in the last week
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Hisyam Othman,5,I'm so lucky to try out this brand new awesome gym on 2nd day opening! Brand new awesome equipments and spacious.. friendly staffs too!! Gonna train more often at this gym!! 💪🏽💪🏽🏋‍♂️,a week ago
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Corentin Roux,5,"An excellent new opening filling the AF desert between City Hall and Chinatown.

2 racks + one Smith, one deadlift platform, plenty of new Hammer Strength bumper plates, Life Fitness machines with two pulldowns and one row - not huge, but enough to get a decent strength training workout done. The cardio side has the usual AF lineup of rower, stairs, elliptical and many treadmills, all modern with big screens.

The advantage of AF is of course the global network, particularly in Asia. I've worked out in small Australian towns, central Tokyo and the suburbs of Seoul. It's also 24/7 which was much appreciated in the hyper crowded Orchard and City Hall branches. If you are considering a membership, these are strong positives and not really offered by other chains.

If I were to suggest some improvements: add a couple more barbells and perhaps Eleiko competition grade ones like at Orchard and City Hall, add one more deadlift area, add a lever to load the deadlift bar, and maybe give yourself a few minutes to wipe all the new bumper plates and bars of oil. But these are very minor things. Great gym.",a week ago
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,SC Hung,5,"I was lucky to use this place on just their second day after the grand opening. Brand-new equipment, friendly staff, and I had a very satisfying two-hour workout.",a week ago
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Micky P,4,"Has that brand new car smell! Awesome gym densely packed with functional brand new gear. But could use some more rehab foam rollers, bands etc",in the last week
Anytime Fitness Bugis,Sihan Goi,5,"A pretty decent gym spread across the 3rd and 4th floors of a commercial building at the junction of Middle Road and another small lane.
3rd floor has cardio machines, cable machines, a few plate loaded machines, dumbbells up to 30kg, 2 power racks, a Smith machine, benches. 4th floor gets more serious with 6 power racks with attached platforms (but somehow only 5 barbells), a hex bar, a short bar, ez bar, fixed bars, benches, dumbbells up to 50kg, plate loaded machines, bumper plates and rubberized plates.
About the barbells, I remember seeing Eleiko bars advertised, but the 5 bars there were brandless hybrid bars with both PL and WL markings on a rather smooth knurl, so you may have grip issues if lifting heavy. Thankfully, all of them spin OK. Perhaps the Eleiko bars (if they have any) are kept during non staffed hours like some other clubs.

There is a sign at the corner platform that allows chalk usage only there, which is better than pretty much any other AF I've been to since they all disallow chalk usage. You do have up clean up after yourself but that's to be expected.

Went there around 7am on a Friday and trained until around 9am, crowd was also non existent. Not much to complain about equipment wise, except maybe a lack of warmup equipment such as foam rollers, bands, etc, or a space to warm up at. However, facilities wise, there are only 2 shower stalls per floor, and no space to change outside of the stall. I generally don't like to put on my clothes in the shower area since the floors are wet, but in this case there wasn't much choice.",4 months ago
Anytime Fitness Bugis,Syahiran,5,"Outstanding gym with extremely cozy and comfortable setting. Amazing atmosphere with cool music to vibe to.

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Michael Thein,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall is one of the best outlets I’ve trained at. The gym is clean, spacious, and very well-maintained, with large windows and a refreshing skyline view that makes every workout enjoyable.

✅ Environment – Bright, airy, and motivating. The natural light and open feel create a great workout atmosphere.
✅ Location – The best part is that it’s right next to SEAS, which makes it extremely convenient for those nearby.

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Justin Hoyo,5,"One of the better anytime fitness outlets in Singapore’s by far. The gym is extremely spacious, well-equipped, and well maintained. It’s location within city square mall which is convenient from MRT. There’s a total of six power racks and two smith machines. Cable stations are also available. They also have dedicated changing room/toilet area.

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Jane Jha,1,"• Gym's sanitizer spray are often empty, making it difficult to maintain hygiene.

• The wiping cloth provided are consistently dirty, dusty, and have a strong odor. Wet wipes dispenser are always empty

• Members are forced to bring their own wipes because hygiene is essential, yet the gym doesn't supply these basic necessities.

• Despite a rule requiring members to sanitize equipment after use, basic cleaning supplies are not provided.

• Despite paying monthly fees, we are expected to supply our own cleaning materials, and the equipment is frequently dusty and poorly mentained

A well-equipped and welcoming fitness space.

I've been really impressed with this Anytime Fitness location. The gym is well-maintained and offers a complete range of equipment to support any workout style. There's a full set of dumbbells, multiple pull-focused machines (I counted at least four), and a great selection of cardio machines that are almost always available—no waiting around even during peak hours.

Safety is always prioritised and strongly enforced to keep the welfare of the members in mind.

Really spacious gym, even during peak hours, where I am not required to necessarily wait long for equipment or share with that many people. Many mirrors and satisfactory lighting for those who are into taking aesthetic pics/vids.

Super spacious and well organized layout. Lighting is well planned too, which adds to the aesthetics and something out of the ordinary AF gym interiors you might find elsewhere.

I came on a Sunday early afternoon, so the crowd wasn't that bad. I'm sure weekdays after working hours might be worse.

Anytime Fitness City Hall,angelyn mok,5,"Firstly, i would like to compliment to awesome club mgr - Shamil, personal trainer - Hirda & Rasid, they’re very friendly, knowledgeable & patient in their coaching and took their time to explain each equipments.

Secondly, been member about 3 months, during lunch all Treadmill was fully occupied, have to wait about 20-30min, It is wasting time to rush down and waste money for keep paying member fee.

Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Javier Alvira,5,"I recently switched from Virgin Active to Anytime Fitness (AF), and The Concourse location has really impressed me — especially considering I’m paying less than half now. While the space is compact, it’s spotless, well-equipped, and smartly laid out (doesn’t feel crowded, and there are windows all over), and it has everything from a squat rack and Smith machine to free weights, functional training machines, cardio gear and a spectacular new cables station which can accommodate up to 8 simultaneous trainers.

Beyond AF’s ultimate convenience proposition and this center’s effective arrangement, what has stood out most is the support from Hakim, the club manager. A few weeks into my training, after noticing I’d become a regular, he took the initiative to explain how to use the body composition monitor — something no one had ever walked me through before. He also personally helped resolve a billing issue I encountered during my membership transfer, handling it quickly and professionally.

By now, I’ve visited a few AF locations, and while this one is on the smaller side, it easily stands out for its cleanliness, thoughtful setup, and truly supportive management. A great example of how a smaller gym can still offer a high-quality experience.",3 months ago
Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,4,"The pros:
- Quiet, especially on weekends. Good alternative to Bugis bracing.
- For a small location, decent equipment - cable, dumbbells, pin-loaded machines, 1 squat rack, smith machine and good varieties of cardio machines.
- convenient location , near haji lane, Kampong glam,  Golden Mile tower.

The cons:
- small changing room, only 1 shower stall. For toilets, you have to use the buildings public toilet.
- Can get stuffy in certain areas of the gym (mostly fans).
- not suitable for powerlifters like me - only 1 squat rack and no deadlift platform.
- no hip trust machine

Overall, it's a good branch if you're working nearby, or not fussy.",2 months ago
Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Adam Stephen,4,"Update May 2025: Got a new addition cable machine, thank you!!

Anytime Fitness Orchard,chat noir wow,5,"Update 6 April: I’m so glad that they managed to get the air con back for the cardio area. It is now so comforting to run at AF orchard, no other AFs have such pleasant air con for running. It keeps the humidity low and easier for breathing.

I've been coming to AF Orchard for runs on treadmill. The air con used to be good for 10km runs. However, the staff mentioned that the reason for the weak air con at the cardio area is run by the management. While there are fans, but the air remain hot and humid at the treadmills area. I have also observed other runners checking out which treadmill has better ventilation. But they are mostly similar in terms of temperature and ventilation. Otherwise, the staff are great!

Anytime Fitness Raffles Place,Lim,5,"Good gym, despite its small size, lots of equipment to get a decent workout done, impressed with all that they were able to squeeze. The entire space feels semi-broken up into 3 sections though. Plenty of cable stations.
Not sure why some folks are complaining about aircon? It is one of the colder AFs I’ve been to, comparable to JTC summit. Visited on a weekday, able to push hard without sweating. Try AFs like Northpoint and you will know what ‘hot’ feels like.
Cons: lots of white collar folks on weekdays, even at odd timings like 3-4pm. Gets more packed at lunchtime and after work, so avoid those hours. Wish there were more benches, theres only 4 minus the one at the smith machine, they were all occupied on a weekday afternoon. Dumbbell racks split into 2 sides which was abit awkward, and only one deadlift platform tucked in the corner right next to a wall. If you do powerlifting, or simply want a more spacious gym, consider other outlets like City Hall (crowd can be quite bad too)
Mirrors are aesthetic lol

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Ally Ong,5,"I’ve been visiting this gym for a while now, and it’s easily become my happy place. The staff are warm and welcoming, the space is spotless, and the layout is well organized, weights are always perfectly reracked like some behind-the-scenes magic is happening. The equipment is well-maintained it’s spoiled me for other gyms.

Being right in the heart of the CBD, it does get busy during peak hours - think “after-work drinks” level of packed. If that’s not your scene, just tweak your workout time and you’ll have a much smoother experience. The gym is in an older building, which makes its location perfect but also means a little consideration goes a long way: don’t slam the weights (nobody needs a surprise earthquake drill), and be ready to share machines when it’s busy.

I train with Mansor, and honestly, it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. He really knows his stuff and has a sharp eye for safety. Mansor has this rare mix of pushing you to your limits while keeping you grounded, so you’re not just building a Greek god physique, but also the mental toughness to take on the world (or at least your corporate inbox). He might look a little intimidating at first because he enforces the rules (rerack your weights, don’t slam, don’t do anything dangerous), but really, he’s one of the friendliest people you’ll meet as long as you’re not the person trying to turn the gym into a demolition site.

And if you’re curious, check out the PT packages. They’re not just for lifting, you can use them for stretching sessions, or even kickboxing if you need to release some steam after a rough day at the office.

All in all, this gym is a gem. Show up, be respectful, rerack your weights, and don’t be that person, don’t hog machine. If everyone does their part, we’ll all keep enjoying this convenient, vibrant spot in the CBD, a place where you can laugh, sweat, and recharge, together.",a month ago
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Ken Jack,1,"The gym itself is fine, but the personal trainers tend to have a very bad attitude, especially the one with glasses. I have had an extremely unpleasant experience with the same guy two times already. He has been acting like he owns the place and taken over a machine I was using. The way he talked to me was so aggressive that I felt uncomfortable being around. I hope in some way they will have the trainer learn how to speak with the gym users in nicer ways (he seems to be a nice guy towards his “customers”) but if the situation persists, I guess I will have to report it to the HQ of Anytime Fitness.",a month ago
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Terry Samuels,1,"A gym with a very “California Fitness” vibe. The instructors seem more interested in engaging with the ladies than providing professional guidance. While sitting near a machine, I overheard an instructor mocking another member to his client — ironically, the person he was mocking was lifting impressively and doing a workout the instructor himself probably couldn’t manage. Not the kind of Anytime Fitness I’d return to, especially when instructors are busy sizing up guys and acting cheeky only with the girls. Don’t do it so obviously, or at least don’t make comments that could be heard by members.",a month ago

The environment is welcoming, clean, and motivating—perfect for anyone at any fitness level. The gym is well-equipped, and I love that it’s spacious enough to never feel overcrowded.

One of the highlights for me is the swimming pool, which is always well-maintained and a refreshing way to mix up my workouts. On top of that, the pickleball court is such a fun addition—it’s a great way to stay active while enjoying a more social and energetic atmosphere.

What makes the experience even better is the professionalism and support from the trainers, especially Trainer Riffic. He is knowledgeable, encouraging, and knows how to create a workout plan that suits my goals. His energy and guidance make every session productive and enjoyable.

Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Justin Hoyo,3,"Cozy gym located at Mercury Hotel Stevens. Equipment were new and well-maintained, but I would consider this more of an “hotel” gym as it was very small, the weights were quite limited, and there were very few machines as well. Hotel guests (non-af members) could also access and use the gym - which I find quite strange.

One plus point is that af members can use the swimming pool! There is also a pickleball court, but it’s extremely expensive at $45 per hour during peak hours (af members can get $5 off).",4 months ago

Plus it’s tucked away in the open basement area in a cozy little corner in front of the building, with lots of bright sunlight to make it rather pleasant and cheerful. The management are nice, smiled and said hi to me even though it’s my first time there. I recommend this place to gym!",12 months ago
Anytime Fitness Novena,Sihan Goi,3,"Came here on a Monday over lunch. Reached at close to noon and it was getting crowded, by 12+, it was packed. Thankfully, the platform wasn't very popular, though someone did hijack it while I was stretching even though my stuff was there. I didn't really mind since I'm all for sharing, but I thought a little courtesy in asking if the platform is being used would be nice. The platform was also squeezed in between the wall and a pillar, so there's not much space to navigate.

The squat racks were however hot items...except not for squatting. Since it's Monday, apparently everyone was celebrating National Bench Day. I had to wait a while before I could squat.

The equipment is quite alright, though they are all placed in very close proximity to one another, so you need to be very aware of where your going to not intrude on someone else's space. There are 2 full racks with rubberized plays from 1.25-20kg, 4 bars within the racks, another bar on the platform, a full set of Hammer Strength bumper plates, a smith machine, various benches, dumbells till about 35kg, various cable machines and cardio equipment. Nothing out of the ordinary, no specialized bars or other equipment.

The bathroom is unisex, and the water pressure fluctuates, and can get quite low when someone else is showering.",8 months ago

In December 2024, they charged me incorrectly again — luckily, I noticed after doing the math. Then in February 2025, I asked them to terminate my membership by April 15, but they kept delaying it with all sorts of excuses.

I tried their 90 min free trial but the manager was really nice to allow me to stay longer because it was raining cats and dogs outside! It was easy to sign up, I simply dropped them a whatsapp a day before. Trial hours were limited from Monday to Friday 1pm to 7pm (last session at 5.30pm)

I forgot to take photos of the upstairs but there was a stretching area and space for free weights with 4 barbells.

What I really appreciated was a female only toilet! Im considering signing up. Prices were quite pricey now as compared to what I was expecting or have been hearing before where they could be less than $100 per month if you signed for longer. Currently as they stand, what I understand:

Noted that they are adding more machines in dec/jan, but that's 4-5 months of not being able to complete my routine... It's also a stickler for me that there's no fan built into the treadmill...

Pros:
- Great location. Feels atas. Orchard mrt just below.
- Damn helpful and friendly staff , no pushing of PT sessions. Always feel welcome  whenever i go there.
- Big classroom . I need that for my stretching, warmups and sit ups and evening classes
- sizeable shower rooms available , though toilet is outside AF, the public toilets are clean as seldom any crowd at that floor.
- air con is strong.

Cons
- evening crowds but understandable
- can get rather rowdy as international high school students crowd the gym and hog machines in groups.
- and i havent seen them wiping down the equipments after use.
- staff shld check the level of spray bottles periodically as some of them are empty.
- classes only available on weekdays.
- lack of quantity and variety of detachable bars for cable exercises.
- payment provider Ezypay is sneaky and problematic. There are times where payment was claimed to be “ blocked” by my bank but my bank denies that and i got charged penalty of $15 by Ezypay. I have to work around it by paying over the counter earlier than the payment date. AF staff also can provide me with a QR code over whatsapp too.

Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Daniel Ng,3,"A strange AF located right opposite Cantonment Police Station. It's a 4-storey shop house. The 1st level kinda has dungeon vibes, very gritty, low ceilings, 1 squat rack, smith machine, leg press, deadlift platform and dumbbells up to 50kg. L2 has cardio machines and a couple of random plate loaded machines. L3 is all Life Fitness machines with the cable stack as well. At L4 there's a random glute extension and back extension as well as dual pulley cables. Overall it's a little bit small and narrow but decently well equipped. The showers are very tiny though and aren't exactly the cleanest around. Overall a convenient gym if you're in the area but loses a couple stars due to cleanliness/maintenance and inconvenience of the 4-floor layout.

Not ideal for leg day cos you'll have to climb stairs haha.",a year ago

Wonderful gym with all the required equipments and a friendly staff. The gym is very clean and not crowded if you are to visit between 1-5pm. Equipments are brand new.
They have Zumba, Hatha Yoga, body combat, Yin yoga, muay thai, and pilates each day late evening as complimentary
The gym consists of two floors. The ground floor is for weights and the first floor is cardio and threadmill and free style.
The staff are very friendly. Specially Minn is very approachable and is open to suggestions and feedback. She even sorted out some confusions regarding the transfer of membership from keppel.

Anytime Fitness Kim Seng CC,Starry Snow,1,"I'm extremely let down by the lack of response, concern and most importantly accountability by both Kim Seng AF and its instructors for a ribcage injury i suffered during muay thai class last Saturday.

If you care about your safety during class, this is not the place to come as they do not care about nor manage the risks for you.

It was only my 2nd lesson for muay thai and the instructors (whom knew me from their previous kickboxing class) paired me with 2 much stronger and seasoned girls for long guard practice, for us to take turns to practise with one another.

One of the girls whom had partnered with me the week before and knew my level suddenly pushkicked me with considerable strength and i was taken aback. I felt pain on my tummy area and later on in the class when i informed the key instructor, he said a mild kick is ok even if i wasn't braced for impact. I practically skipped the latter part of group practice with the girls cos they were going at each other and i wasnt comfortable.

The pain persisted and i kept the instructor updated as it was so bad i couldnt sleep properly at night. Although he did respond, it was passive and i was just told to monitor it. I texted Kim Seng on sunday to inform about it and there was no reply since it was unstaffed which i understood.

On monday the pain and also bloatedness was still felt so i went to see a GP in the afternoon, n it was assessed that the pain came from the tip of my ribcage, meaning the push kick had been on my ribcage.

I updated both the key instructor and Kim Seng AF regarding the doc assessment. By then Kim Seng AF hadnt even responded to my initial text sent on sunday. When there was a reply, it was only an apology for late reply as the person standing in, a fitness instructor had been with a client. He said he would pass the message to the team for a follow up. I sent a text on tuesday to ask when can i expect a follow up, and there is no response at all, while i am writing this at 5ish pm on wed.

The key instructor's initial response to me was to deflect all responsibility, to it being an unfortunate event, claiming he cant control students' behavior and mistakes, that a push kick could be anywhere on the body as it is to simulate a street fight on defence and attack. That injuries are unavoidable. He assumed the girl's kick was unintentionally strong, even though he said he and the assistant instructor are unable to control n monitor everyone or give a person more attention to the other. Only after i persisted in my points on the lack of safety measures did he apologise on his carelessness.

Prior to this, i had a good impression of Kim Seng AF, of the instructors. So i even recommended my other gym frens from my previous AF to come here. They respond very fast when you ask about classes.

However when it comes to injury accountability, while I suffered an unnecessary painful injury, all that they responded was silence, deflecting of fault.

I do not find delight in writing this review. But if you want a safe environment and a gym that cares about your wellbeing, avoid this place.",6 months ago
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Chloe Kang,2,"This AF is just too small. During the golden hours around 7 to 8 pm, it gets way too crowded. It really difficult to work out.

Anytime Fitness Stevens,Huimin,5,"I joined Anytime Fitness Stevens in Oct 2024 towards the end of a personal training program elsewhere, and looking for another gym to sustain my fitness journey on my own.  Been with AF Stevens for about 5 months. I chose this as my home gym as it is very near MRT like maybe a few mins walk away and is on my route to office. AF Stevens is pretty well equipped, usually well maintained with 4 squat racks, hack squat machine, hip thrust machine, smith machine, back extension, pec fly machine, leg extension, hip abductor machine, T-bar, seated rows, lat pull down, at least 4 benches and many more, and also a separate room beside for cardio machines like treadmills. The gym is well spaced and not so crowded at least during the time I usually go. What I like most is the gym provides lockers (u use your own padlock but that is good enough) and has shower facilities which some other AF gyms don’t have which is important to me as I don’t live exactly near the gym.

They also provide sanitizer sprays and towels for us to wipe the machines which some other AF gyms don’t have.  It is well ventilated air conditioned with fans rotating and blowing.

I am shifting house in a few months time and the AF gym which is in my new neighbourhood does not have locker and shower facilities…

I think I will miss AF Stevens already…

Anytime Fitness Stevens,szehow ng,1,"I’ve been frequenting AF Stevens branch for over 3 years now. Throughout my time here, I can say that this is a good gym with nice equipment and a great owner.

Unfortunately, a highly unpleasant experience with one of their staff (I suspect I know which one) has led me to the decision to stop frequenting this branch.

The incident involved a fine (of which I received no warning of). When discussing the matter, the staff member, among other things, threatened to block access to my FOB and refused to allow me to talk directly to the boss. The issue does not lie with the fine itself - I am open to paying it. The issue lies in the manner and unprofessionalism in which this particular staff member dealt with the issue. It is poor business sense and no way to treat a loyal customer of 3+ years. My requests of speaking directly with the boss were reasonable and appropriate.

As a result of all this, I’ll be looking to change my membership to a more convenient location near my workplace at the earliest opportunity.

It’s unfortunate that this singular experience with this particular staff member has ruined an otherwise pleasant 3+ years at AF Stevens. I’d recommend the owner to take corrective action against the staff in question, so as to avoid similar incidents happening to other members in the future. It’s particularly disappointing and unfortunate, as I have actually talked to the owner on multiple occasions, and he is a very nice uncle.",11 months ago

From day one, he’s made the gym feel like more than just a place to work out, it’s become a space that feels warm, welcoming, and motivating, all thanks to his energy and effort.

Every time I walk through those doors, without fail, Ayden greets me with a big smile and a friendly “How’s it going?” Even on the days when I’m dragging my feet in, somehow his energy gives me that boost I need. He doesn’t just stop at a hello either. He checks in regularly to make sure I’m enjoying my workouts, the environment, and even the music playing in the background, which somehow is always on point. I swear he’s got a playlist for every mood.

One thing that always makes me laugh is his classic gym dad joke: “Why don’t skeletons ever go to the gym? Because they don’t have the guts!” It’s always delivered with the most serious face, which somehow makes it even funnier.

It’s the small gestures the check-ins, the consistent positivity, the genuine effort to connect with members that really set Ayden apart. He goes above and beyond to ensure everyone feels comfortable and cared for in the gym, whether you’re a regular or someone just starting out.

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Maryy Tan,1,"Disclosure: l am a current member of AF BTC and am sharing my personal experience. I am not affiliated with the gym owner or staff. Recent LL post is questionable (as gf of staff J). This gym USED to be my favourite, but unfortunately, things have taken a downturn in recent months. The overall experience has become less enjoyable, primarily due to changes in staff behaviour and management response.
To the management and owner: This feedback is meant to be constructive. Members like myself have provided feedback in the past, but responses often feel generic and unaddressed. Simply directing members to a phone number without real action leaves concerns unresolved.
Here are some of the key issues observed:
1. Member Experience & Capacity: Happy existing members are your best advocates. Smiling ear to ear when signing up new customers is total contrast to sulky cold attitude when help requested by existing customers. Recently, the gym feels overcrowded and noisy, which impacts the workout environment. This has been mentioned in earlier reviews and remains a concern.
2. Cleanliness & Facilities: Toiletries used to be regularly replenished, and hygiene standards were high. Lately, maintenance appears inconsistent. The shower area now has temporary plastic racks on the floor, which adds clutter and feels unhygienic.
3. Noise Levels & Staff Conduct: Music volume is already high, but it is sometimes overpowered by loud conversations at the reception area (staff consistently socialising loudly amongst themselves beyond lunch hours). This detracts from the workout atmosphere.
4. Hygiene Measures: The removal of wet wipe stands has caused inconvenience. Using spray bottles and towels that may not be sanitized adequately raises hygiene concerns. Requests for wipes are often met with a standard “out of stock” dismissive response by Jamie.
5. Equipment Accessibility: Some equipment appears to be stored in restricted-access room. It can be frustrating for members when staff do not readily assist in locating these items. Had a recent bad experience with staff Carmen - unwillingness to help shows in her sulky face.
Lastly, I hope this feedback is taken seriously by the management. The decline in service standards may eventually lead members to seek alternatives. Maintaining a positive, professional environment is key to retaining loyal members.",4 months ago

Anytime Fitness Bishan,Sihan Goi,4,"Went for a lunchtime workout on a Monday. Reached around 11 and it was quite crowded. Strangely, the crowd dissipated after a while.

Gym is quite new and has quite an extensive array of Hammer Strength and Lifefitness equipment. 4 racks (2 half and 2 cages), 2 platforms with 2 sets of bumper plates plus 2 extra pairs of 20s. 1 hybrid bar (both PL/WL knurlings) per rack/platform, and there are several metal 2.5kg collars, which are very rare in globogyms, though not very necessary outside of competition.

Not much to complain about if you're a regular gymrat or even powerlifter. However, as a weightlifter, I'd have to say that the bars are sub par. They look OK at first glance, but most of them don't spin properly. I found 2 that aren't stuck, but even then they aren't smooth. That's my biggest gripe and the main reason why it's not 5 stars. Also, the racks are setup very near one another so it's difficult to change plates because the bars are so close to one another. Lastly, the racks have very wide intervals between the hooks, so if you're unlucky, you may not find a good position.  There are also no specialty bars such as trap bars or football/Swiss bars, but that's a minor grievance.",a year ago

Be aware though that weights are generally not returned so you might need to run around to get the right weights for some machines. Only 2 free weight racks means you might have a wait when it's busy as well.

There's also a lone C2 rower, which is nice to see since most other AF gyms seem to favour water rowers instead.

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Vincent Pang,4,"ANYTIME FITNESS Potong Pasir: A Solid Choice with Room for Improvement

ANYTIME FITNESS Potong Pasir offers a convenient location and a well-equipped facility. The 24/7 access is a significant perk, allowing for flexible workout schedules. The gym is generally clean and well-maintained, thanks to the diligent cleaning staff.

The staff are friendly and helpful, providing assistance when needed. However, the atmosphere could be enhanced with better music distribution, especially on the ground floor.
The free WiFi is a nice touch, but the outdated hotspot model can be frustrating. Upgrading to a regular WiFi setup with secure WEP access would significantly improve the user experience.

While the gym is accessible, the lack of a covered walkway can be a bit inconvenient on rainy days, particularly for those who park further away.

Additionally, the ground floor can get quite warm in the afternoons, especially when the sun is shining.

A few suggestions to improve the gym experience:
* Install cubbies on the ground floor: This would be convenient for members who prefer to store their belongings on the ground floor.

* Install heat film on the ground floor: This would help regulate the temperature and create a more comfortable workout environment.

* Implement stricter rules against hogging machines: Clear signage or verbal reminders could discourage members from monopolizing equipment.

* Upgrade the WiFi system: A more user-friendly WiFi system would enhance the overall gym experience.

Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Wong Peiliang (Guy Wong),1,"I went to this gym thrice over 3 weeks. This is my honest review after the 3 experiences & not 1 off. I really like to love this gym as it is closest to me, but it seriously needs a refresh and surgery! This is the 2nd oldest AF gym in SG, but they really didn't maintain it! Worst of all the AF gyms I have been to in SG so far.

Gym is really old and dirty. I honestly do not think that cleaning was done over these 3 weeks. My nose itches
when I am at dumbbell rack for extended period. Dirt and dust have gathered at corners of machines (photo of dust at Pec machine), thick layer of dust from aircon, dirt from dumbbell racks have not been cleaned since my 1st visit 3 weeks ago. Equipment has rusted or have seriously been used beyond point of replacement (see 9kg dumbbell, exposed plates and attachments). The weights barbell of the short barbells used for curls are also not labelled. Each barbell's weight was off and I had to measure via the weighing machine to conclude that 3 barbells weighed 6.4kg, 8kg and 12.8kg. another one rusted at side which I didn't bother.

Also have entitled old member (Saw him on 2 of the 3 times I went) that I saw bring up his personal bike to park inside the gym and once letting the community stray cat in, which terrified a female user and also caused stress for other users as we were worried of hurting it by accident.

Please give a thumbs up if you have a bad experience at this gym too so that the algorithm can push this review out more and help other people.

Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Ben Kang,5,"My home gym is Anytime Fitness Kovan (JForte). But today, I decided to venture to Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon. Zero regrets. This gym has the legendary Hammer Strength Plate Loaded Glute Drive machine. This S Tier machine alone makes me give a 5 star rating.

Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon > Anytime Fitness Kovan / Anytime Fitness Nex.

I’m writing this review out of my own volition: I was in the gym super early, so no chance to get the freebies.

Pros:
- Clean, well-maintained, efficient, high-quality equipment.
- Excellent music selection, not too loud. The music is on the chill end, which is perfect for the breaks between intense sets. During the sets, you can use your own earphones to play your favourite lifting songs.
- Water cooler is right next to the sink.

Possible improvements (I will transfer my membership + immediately sign my parents, relatives, friends here if they have these):
- Replace Lying Leg Curl -> Hammer Strength Select Seated Leg Curl (with thigh pads, NOT the Precor one with shin pads). Something about better stretch mediated hypertrophy. For hardcore people who still want to target the Biceps Femoris Short Head more, they can hop to the nearby iGym for their Lying Leg Curl.
- Hammer Strength Select Hip Abduction. Not a deal breaker, but great to have, cuz the nearby iGym has a Hip Abduction machine too.
- More 20kg plates on the Hammer Strength Plate Loaded Glute Drive. Cuz this is one of the few exercises which can be overloaded a lot. Having more 20kg plates here means less need to grab from the leg press and other places.
- Dedicated Bulgarian Split Squats support (short adjustable stand with the roller pad for the back leg). This won’t occupy much space.

Anyways, having the Hammer Strength Plate Loaded Glute Drive machine makes it worth the walk from Kovan MRT to Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon, instead of the Anytime Fitness Kovan. This gym is small, but it has the Hammer Strength stuff. Hammer Strength is like the Ferrari of gym equipment.

Pro tip: the 24Hr An-Nur makmak beside it sells really clean food. Plain rice + Sambal fish + Egg. ;)

To Anytime Fitness Kovan (if you are even reading this), I am personally willing to fund these machines to make you on-par with Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon (so I don’t need to walk that much). I’m the person who replenished the barbell hip thrust pads btw. You have so much gym real estate, so much potential, don’t waste it.",2 months ago

So you see people running this gym is serious abt getting fit and trimming fats! Great job to the manager Eugene!

The platform area is very cramped, and it looks like they barely squeezed everything there, so you people who wish to access the stairs that side will need to step over the platform. Upstairs, there's a studio for stretching, dumbbells up to 50kg and benches, some other machines, and bathrooms. All in all, the equipment and facilities are quite new and clean and the crowd wasn't that much (perhaps because it was raining).

The only downside is that its slightly cramp as all the machines are super close to each other and very little walking space. So if you come during peak hour and hate crowd, you gonna have a tough time, especially at the deadlift area.

Firstly manager uses the gym as her own personal gym to run her own personal trainer business training her clients together with her partner. Always hogging multiple equipment and machines and talking laughing so loudly!

Secondly they are not even promoting the AF pt sessions and illegally pushing her own agenda. Was told off by her staff when I was just help my friend correcting her stating no coaching was allowed when I’m not even a PT and just barely helping my friend.

Staff don’t give a damn about gym equipment cause everything I visit the weights and plates are all over when they are 2-3 staff and nobody bothers to arrange it back properly. Why are you getting paid again?

Finally, they had a renovation taking away all shower , toilet and changing room facilities. It’s been 2 days since they promised the end of construction so when I went in to workout, after my training I asked the staff where to shower and change one of the male staff had the audacity to ask me to change in the locker area which was an open area next to the water cooler and near the lockers accessible to both men and women.

He listens carefully and more than happy to guide me through each workout and always makes sure I’m pushing myself to the limit without overexerting (which may result in injury in worst case scenario).

Both session with Kal has been challenging but also enjoyable as he always takes the time to explain the purpose behind each exercise and how it may affect my hiking capacity in the long run. He’s also very attentive during my workout session, correcting my posture and making sure I'm not injure during my workout.

Anytime Fitness New Upper Thomson,Sihan Goi,5,"Came here on a tuesday morning and it was relatively quiet. This was the first AF I visited at the start of COVID-19, but I didn't join it then as the equipment wasn't what I expected, i.e. bumper plates and platforms. They recently got bumper plates and a platform (I think as part of their ""glow up"") so I visited it. The gym is rather small, but has quite a lot of equipment over 2 floors. Pretty much everything I need for a good strength workout. Free weights wise, there's 1 Hammer Strength full power rack with attached platform, another half rack, 2 sets of HS bumper plates from 10-25kg, except 20kg which has 3 sets, many other black rubberised plates, and 3 F1 recreation barbells that spin, but aren't as ""tight"" as the spin bars at other AF that use Eleiko/Ziva/HS/unbranded bars. It's 99% there though, but you will feel a bit of ""give"" when loading the HS bumper plates. Minor complaint. Another issue is that the ceilings aren't very high, so the pull up bars at the top of the racks are pretty much unusable as your head will likely hit the ceiling if you try doing pullups there. There are also various cable machines and cardio equipment

Upstairs, there are dumbbells up to 50kg, fixed bars, plate loaded machines, a warmup place with bands, kettlebells, a plyo-box, medicine balls, foam rollers, yoga blocks, and other assorted stuff. Strangely, there's a small glass room with a platform, half rack, barbells and plates, but it was for ""Authorised personnel only"". This is the first AF I've been to that has this, I guess it's anytime but not anywhere.

“Good morning, if the issue is due to bank , then bank should bear this extra cost incurred to you and do the needful from their end. Hope you understand our side that just like you, we, AFPL can not bear this extra cost either as its not even our fault.”

As a paying customer, I had expected more understanding and support from the gym. Definitely not continuing my membership here after this experience.",a month ago
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Potato,1,"The shower doesn't have hot water, and after aerobic exercise, you can only use cold water. The drastic change in body temperature can cause blood vessels to contract too quickly, posing a risk. Additionally, the equipment is outdated, and the water from the dispenser has a strange taste. I strongly recommend going to another place; this one is completely unacceptable.",5 months ago
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Hung Hao,4,"Mixed feelings- this is an awesome place for those hustling for a narly leg pump. With a myriad of leg day machines, even the famed Hack Squat, I would love to come here for a leg day workout!

There is certainly more than enough machines here to tickle any fancy. I think that it is rather spacious, and also I went at the peak and did not find it crowded.

Another plus point would be the two vending machines, one with purely drinks, and another one with more protein based beverages.

However, there are certain things that I found lacking.

Firstly, free weight dumbbells only go up to the maximum weight of 40kg, and surprisingly, the pair of 37.5kgs were missing.  Colour me confused, as I expected dumbbells to usually hit about 50kg in max weight. Not that I use those, but still, probably important for the big guy right?

Secondly, the toilet seemed rather dirty when I used it. Again, not the end of the world and certainly not a reflection of the outlet. But it would be nice to figure that out.",2 years ago
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Lucien Lim,4,"Has all the equipment needed for a complete workout. Do note the limited amount of benches, which can make waiting times longer during peak hours. Aside from that, the gym is well maintained with clean toilets and equipment.",2 years ago
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,A Josh Lin,5,"I frequent Grantral Complex regularly as it's conveniently located just below my workplace at Grantral Mall, MacPherson. The staff here are consistently courteous and helpful—special thanks to Club Manager Shaffiee, who has always been accommodating to my needs and queries.

That said, my main concern lies with the gym's limited equipment and the condition of some of the machines. Several bench covers are visibly worn out, and during peak hours (especially weekdays from 6–8pm), the gym becomes overcrowded. It's often difficult to get a turn on the machines, with some having to be shared among multiple users at once—highlighting the shortage of key equipment.

Particularly lacking are machines such as the Smith machine, shoulder side lateral raise, pin-loaded bicep curl, and dip stations for lower chest/triceps. Additionally, there’s a lack of mirrors in some areas, which are essential for form checks and training.

I hope the management considers refurbishing the existing equipment and adding more machines. It would greatly improve the gym experience for all members.",3 months ago
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Aspiring Lawnmower,2,"I don't usually leave negative reviews, but this gym is a huge letdown. While the staff are friendly, the maintenance is lacking, especially in the toilets and changing rooms. They're consistently dirty, humid, and smelly, with floors that are always soaking wet. The changing room walls are literally black with dirt, the floor always has rubbish, and you have to wonder if the benches ever get wiped down.

The gym floor is also way too small and under-equipped for the number of people. You'll spend more time waiting for machines than actually working out.

I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere, there are better AF outlets in the area.",3 weeks ago
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Wayne,5,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Stayed after working hours to tend my friends on trial. Gym is clean and big, one of the top few percentiles of the AF in Singapore.

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,ntacx,2,"Unacceptable hygiene standards at this outlet

I understand that Anytime Fitness is a budget gym, but the cleanliness at this location is far below even basic expectations.
•	The toilets are frequently flooded, dirty, and poorly maintained.
•	The drains are often clogged, and there’s a persistent bad smell.
•	Floors throughout the restroom and shower areas are consistently unclean.
•	The showers themselves are in poor condition and unpleasant to use.
•	Changing Room 1 has only one bench, and Changing Room 2 has none at all—this makes it inconvenient for members trying to change comfortably.

Post-workout showers should be a chance to cool down and feel refreshed, but the state of these facilities makes that impossible.

Also, good luck completing a workout on a weekday. Totally insufficient space and equipment for the number of members.

However, the staff are friendly and approachable. Reminded them on the state of the hygiene in the toilets once, and it did improve for awhile, but it’s back to being bad again.",5 months ago
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Mark Lim,3,"This gym pretty much fits all my needs. It's a pretty good gym, I'd expect a bit more for the price but it isn't the worst, and still good value for money. 3 things though:

The AC could be better. It's pretty warm when I go in the mornings. Cardio area is also directly under the sun's glare in the mornings.

The leg press has pretty much 0 depth, can't do full ROMs on it.

The issue that gave this 2 stars though is the middle aged couple that other reviews have pointed out are still at it. It is something to consider when choosing this gym. The middle-aged lady in skimpy, almost see-through clothing, the creepy guy taking her videos, zooming in and out of various body parts, with the flash on most times.

I highly advise the staff of this gym to please look into this. I can't recommend this gym at all if this isn't addressed.

Edit 3rd July: haven't seen the couple in 2 weeks now. Raising my review to 3 stars, I'll check back in in a month.",3 months ago
Anytime Fitness NEX,Ernz Lim,1,"Super duper crowded during peak hour, everything is being used, machines and equipment are the most rundown I’ve ever seen at any AF gym. The weights are all without numberings and they can’t bare to replace them and resort to using a piece of paper to write the numbers on it.",a week ago
Anytime Fitness NEX,Aileen Vitug,1,"Anytime Fitness NEX has been one of the most disappointing gym experiences I've ever had. Despite the 24/7 access being advertised as a major perk, the facility is often overcrowded, there's a queue in using the equipment during peak hours, making it nearly impossible to get a decent workout. Equipment is frequently out of order, and the machines that do work are either outdated or poorly maintained. Cleanliness is another major issue – sweat-streaked benches, dirty floors  are regular occurrences.

The staff seems indifferent at best; they're hardly ever available for help and, when they are, they’re not very welcoming. I signed up and their staff, Grace, promised my partner 1 free month of membership for referring me. She assured us this even if we didn't ask for it but at the end she denied ever saying it, because we didn't have any proof, so we cannot also trust the staff keeping their word. I regret having signed up in this gym, I don't like being lied to.

Anytime Fitness NEX feels like a rip-off and far from the good experience they claim to provide. I’d recommend looking elsewhere if you’re serious about your fitness. Before making a mistake of signing up on this branch.",a year ago
Anytime Fitness NEX,Roger Thomas Tan,5,Great place at NEX! Spacious with lots of machines to use! Other users are friendly and willing to share machines!

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,jian cong chia,5,"This is hands-down the best Anytime Fitness in Singapore I've been to! It's one of the biggest locations I've seen, which means it has a very complete range of equipment—you never have to wait. The entire place is bright, clean, and spacious, making for a really comfortable and motivating workout environment.
A huge bonus is the nice staff and the unexpected perk of free coffee and bananas! It really makes a difference and shows they care. Highly recommended if you're looking for a great place to train",2 weeks ago
Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,5,"The gym is spacious, it has plenty of squat racks and 2 deadlift platforms. The variety of pin loaded machines is good as well.

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Qeerloish,5,"Highly Recommended Gym!
I’ve been really impressed with this gym — the environment is spacious, clean, and filled with well-maintained, modern equipment. The recent renovation gives it a bright and energetic vibe, with great lighting and layout.

The staff are super friendly and helpful — Claire and Jemmy always greet members with a smile and make everyone feel welcome. There’s also a wide variety of group classes to choose from, including Pilates, Body Pump, Body Combat, Yoga, and more, suitable for all fitness levels.

For those looking for personal guidance, the trainers here are knowledgeable and professional — especially Risham, who is very experienced and motivating.

Overall, it’s a fantastic gym with great facilities, a positive atmosphere, and a supportive team. Perfect place to stay fit and inspired! 💪",in the last week
