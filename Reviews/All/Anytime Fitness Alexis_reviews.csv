Anytime Fitness Alexis,Larry K,5,"Staffs are really friendly here and make members feel at home too whenever they see a member walks into the gym they greet them with a smile too, that’s very nice and rare to see in other AF gyms too!!

Gym lighting looks pretty good now and of course this gotta be one of the cleanest AF in Singapore too! 💪🏼

Machines here are well maintained and staffs are approachable and know their machines well, when a member needs help with certain machines or equipment can ask for help comfortably too :)

10/10!! 💯",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21WNFRURm5hRE5rVjJoMGJIRlVNMnM0YldSa1NWRRAB
Anytime Fitness Alexis,Su Lee,5,"This is my ...3rd to 4th time here
Perhaps once in a month or few months here

Still so lovely...I love that there is one toilet and some shower rooms... Clean and in good condition overall.. it's quite spacious and there are alot of equipments. Not convenient to take pics as there are quite a number of members",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNld09QTXR3RRAB

Excellent gym. Weights, Stations, HIIT, Cardios and Recovery. The full works. Most complete - Even a punching bag and roller foams station with kettlebells. Good gym crowd - All purposeful. Towards students, mature and hardcores. Well laid out - split sections. Cardios facing big wall glass - expansion. 3 cubicles for shower 🚿. Always staffed and polite. Probably best AF I have been.

Best hours - 9am to 3pm",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCcUsycmJ3EAE

Anytime Fitness Alexis,Chili Red Arowana,1,"Big turn off, i cant find the toilet? You walk in you just see the exercise areas.. where is the locker or toilet? 2nd big problem is overcrowded, the weights/mat area is so tiny, one muscle man indian can chope about 30% of the space already? Another 30% a girl put a mat do her stretching？ its a small outlet, and too many ppl come here..",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VKbUx1c0tMczVYLVJREAE
Anytime Fitness Alexis,AP,4,"Great gym but needs to calibrate space management (equipment vs crowd). Staff also seems to have some misunderstanding with member - Approached a member who is on earpiece to lower down volume when no words have been spoken. When asked to clarify, unable to give a satisfactory explanation as to the request.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBNm9mQUVnEAE

Anytime Fitness Alexis,CH,4,"Good small clean gym with plenty of equipment but theres only one toilet and its always crowded no matter what time. Members spotted using more than one bar rack despite the peak crowd. I will go there less because of the horrible crowd. 4/5 for the gym, 1/5 for the crowd/members.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaaWUyU0tnEAE
Anytime Fitness Alexis,Jem Jem,1,"Bad experience for a free trial. Went with a friend (who is a member) and got turned away because they apparently need to reply you and confirm that they have slots for you to trial when there are hardly anyone in the gym. And your trial time is the whole day but restricted to 12-4pm only?

Said you should have called us. But there was no contact number to call in the first place and nothing was stated on their website. Profiled you based on where you stay and recommended a day pass of $30 instead of being flexible about it. Heard alot of great comments but am very disappointed of their service. Rather go to other Anytime fitness outlets.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaeTdLU2lRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Alexis,Rudy Feroz,4,"What's nice is that there are 3 showers, the equipments are brand spanking new (as they should be) and there's tons of cardio machines. For it's size and the fact it's a relatively new gym, there CAN be quite a crowd even during non-peak periods. There is only one toilet which is a minor but possibly inconvenient issue nonetheless depending on the situation. Overall, the toilet and shower area is clean, comes with rain showers, has sizeable mirrors and also comes equipped with hair dryers. For those that regularly check their bodyweight, you'll be happy to know that they do have a weighing scale which provides full body stats, that is unfortunately ONLY accessible during staffed hours and is a paid service. Not so much an issue for anyone with their own weighing scales or those visiting during staffed hours. If your clanging and banging schedule starts at 4am though, you're probably better off visiting another gym to get your weight stats in. The dumbell rack area is definitely a little cramped compared to other AF's of a similar size, so best to avoid peak hours if there's gonna be a few exercises on the list that need you to spend quite abit of time in that section. The rest of the equipments like squat, Smith rack and all the other machines are quite well spaced out. They have a standard line up of equipments that you'd be able to find in most AF's but they definitely stand out with 2 additional equipments which are the seated calf raise and standing leg curls machines, definitely not a common sight in alot of other AF's. The only reason I'm going with 4 stars and not 5 today is cuz I really felt that they could have  designed a little more space to accommodate a slightly larger studio/functional area. A quick chat with any of the staff there and you will probably discover that it's unlikely that there will be a wide range or variety of (if any) classes offered at this AF, not a problem for the weight lifting crowd but definitely a no-go for those who typically visit gyms for classes like HIIT or Yoga etc. Another noteworthy point especially for those that enjoy their ready-made protein drinks or canned pre-workouts from the vending machines that you can usually find across some other AF's, is that you probably might need to bring your own to this outlet as they didn't have a vending machine (at least when I last visited them a couple weeks back that is) throughout my visits.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlbzdidFZBEAE

Anytime Fitness Alexis,The walking Fridge,5,A lot of different machines and equipments. Fairly big space and everything is well maintained. Hands down one of the best anytime fitness gym,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkZ3Q2LWxnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Alexis,In2rovert Life,5,"Newly opened gym (July 2022)

Quite big and has plenty of treadmills/bikes etc

Has everything except seated Bicep/Tricep Machine, Seated Dip Machine, and at the time the set racked barbells went up to only 20kg, believe the heavier ones hadn't arrived yet.

But large multi workout stations and plenty of other machines, inclined Leg Press, squat racks(x2) and a dedicated Deadlift, Crossfit small area make up for it, even has a punching bag/yoga corner.

Quite rare it had a decline chest press machine.

Has 1 toilet, 4 showers with curtains, not glass, the usual lockers(open or close), water cooler, sink, and an area to blow dry your hair.

Staff are friendly.

Nice area as its just a stone's throw from Queenstown MRT, and a short walk to Anchorpoint/Queensway Shopping Centre (the gym is under Alexis condo)",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NS1fNF9RRRAB
