Anytime Fitness Serangoon Garden,Justin Hoyo,3,"Visited this gym as the Evolt body scanner machine is free to use 24/7. But the gym itself is mediocre purely because the equipment, barbell and dumbbells are very poorly maintained. The barbells are especially rusty and smelly. Benches are also worn and metals were rusty.

If I ignore the poor maintenance, this outlet actually has potential - 2 stories, good variety of equipment and wide range of dumbbells/weight plates.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21VMGEzSjRabVZ6WTFSSFZEZGtWblpQTjJveVJrRRAB

The gym is always clean, well-maintained, and equipped with a wide range of modern machines and free weights to suit all fitness levels.

i got an injury requiring surgery and obtained a doctor's memo for premature termination of my contract with AF serangoon gardens. initially i tried to continue gymming but my surgery recovery was being impaired by the workouts, hence my surgeon and physical therapist suggested i cease my gym activities. AF serangoon gardens was being very difficult with processing my termination, citing that they saw me previously at the gym, and various clauses in the contract despite my very valid reason for termination alongside proper documentation and doctor's letter in alignment with the contract. this was very tedious and left a very terrible impression of this gym. highly DO NOT recommend having to deal with the staff here.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VPYVQwNU9XbkxLQkxBEAE

Anytime Fitness Serangoon Garden,Dharshini Elangoven,1,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and concern regarding an incident that took place during my recent visit to your gym. I was working out with my friend, who trains frequently, so that I could learn from her—especially since I am still improving my form on certain exercises. However, during our session, a trainer named Eugene approached my friend and abruptly told her that she needed to leave the gym immediately.

He claimed to have been watching us through the surveillance cameras and assumed that my friend was a personal trainer. Instead of approaching her directly in a respectful manner to clarify the situation, he made an immediate judgment based on camera footage and proceeded to tell her off in an unprofessional and discourteous way. This interaction was not only rude but also felt unethical and completely unnecessary.

This experience has left me feeling extremely uncomfortable and hesitant about returning to the gym. I now question the level of surveillance being conducted on members while they train. What is the intent behind watching members through cameras while they work out? Should I now be worried that I am constantly being monitored and scrutinized while simply trying to improve my fitness?

I have always believed that Anytime Fitness promotes a welcoming and supportive environment, but this experience has made me feel otherwise. I urge you to address this issue and ensure that members are treated with respect rather than suspicion. I hope you take this feedback seriously, as no one should feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in a space meant for health and wellness.

I would appreciate a response regarding this matter and what steps will be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRMGV2QVBREAE

Anytime Fitness Serangoon Garden,Van Cliff,1,"We came to visit this AF branch an hours ago because me and my friend plan to have a good brunch around the area. Unfortunately we were treated as if we trespass or came to the gym drunk and make noise. This unbelievable behaviour of whom they called “club MANAGER” approach us in a very rude manner and said “you have to leave the gym”. I’m like why? Then he showed me his cctv showing me stopping my set and told me “you’re a trainer”
If I look like a trainer than you then that’s a compliment but it would be great if next time you learn and apply to approach things like this in a professional way.
I am a professional IFBB bodybuilder. If I want to train my clients, I’ll train them in my own gym because I have my own one.  I came to train with my friend who needs a push and guide into a gym and go for a brunch after. If going to a gym looking fit more than your own trainers is a problem then you have a very toxic fitness environment for public. You shouldn’t allow people enter your gym as looking fit makes you look like a trainer.

It’s a shame that a person (head trainer Eugene) who conducting client kept looking at the phone monitoring us on cctv what were doing. In front of our eyes his client came without warm up and cool down, session finished in 30mins just doing a cable row. What a pitiful experience for those innocent people who got daylight rubbery by this kind of trainers (head trainer) take note!
My friend who’s considering to take a PT here as she lived nearby changed her mind because of what we have witnessed.

They banned me just like that base on his inferiority. But you don’t have to take an effort to ban me actually. because I will never want to see your face again. Focus on your job Mr. Manager aka head trainer. You’re lacking your professionalism as a “MANAGER” and even as a “TRAINER”. It’s 0%.

There is a good selection of machines and free weights, they are well maintained, albeit some signs of wear and rust are evident. One could easily get a full body workout should he/she wishes to. Early mornings and afternoons are the best times to visit.

Cons: It is a small gym and it gets really, really, really crowded during peak hours, a crowd management system could be of use. There is also a growing clique of youngsters who seem more obsessed with filming TikTok videos of their deadlifts/squats, hogging the weights and proving their masculinity to their friends.
