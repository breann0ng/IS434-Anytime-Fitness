Anytime Fitness Jurong,Hamid Harron,5,"I’ve been going to AF Jurong for a while now, and it’s easily one of the best neighborhood gyms around. The equipment is well-maintained, the space is always clean, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced lifter, there’s something for everyone here.

What really sets this gym apart is the community—everyone is supportive and motivated, making workouts so much more enjoyable. There’s never an issue with overcrowding, and the membership rates are very reasonable for the quality you get.

Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a no-nonsense, well-equipped gym with a great atmosphere!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBMHR2OUdnEAE
