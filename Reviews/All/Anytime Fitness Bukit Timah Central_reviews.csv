Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Danish Bashah,5,"I had a great experience getting my gym membership sorted out, all thanks to Jamie. From the moment I walked in, she was friendly, welcoming, and incredibly helpful. She made the whole registration process smooth and stress-free, patiently answering all my questions and making sure I understood everything about the membership options.

Jamie was also very knowledgeable about the gym facilities and even gave me a quick tour to get me familiar with the place. You can tell she genuinely cares about helping people and making sure they feel comfortable. Thanks again, Jamie – you made a great first impression and really set the tone for a positive start to my fitness journey!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25WVVlrMDBSMDFWY0U1UVVXVjVkRzFPUjI5RE0xRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Elston,5,"Next-level luxury gym experience!
This isn’t just a gym – it’s a premium wellness destination. The space is stunning, from the sleek design to the high-end equipment and spa-like amenities. Everything feels exclusive yet welcoming. You can tell they’ve spared no expense creating a space that motivates and inspires.

What really sets this place apart, though, is the team. Faith is an absolute gem – always warm, professional, and genuinely invested in your fitness goals. Her energy and attention to detail make every visit a pleasure. And Kieran brings such a great vibe – knowledgeable, approachable, and always ready to help or offer encouragement. Together, they make you feel like more than just a member – you feel part of a community.

If you’re looking for a luxurious gym with top-tier service, this is it.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKTU1GQmpabkZHWTBrMk16TlRiMUozWHpJNVdsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Lukas,1,"The floor is extremely hazardous. A lot of the metallic corners are broken and are not repaired/labeled. I slipped on an area near the lat pulldown machine. A lot of the equipment has very obvious wear and tear. Additionally, the staff that was working at the time of visit was completely oblivious to any member entering or exiting the gym.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT205d1kwOW5jMnhJV1V0RlpEaHRSVlYzTWs1UlRuYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Maryy Tan,1,"Disclosure: l am a current member of AF BTC and am sharing my personal experience. I am not affiliated with the gym owner or staff. Recent LL post is questionable (as gf of staff J). This gym USED to be my favourite, but unfortunately, things have taken a downturn in recent months. The overall experience has become less enjoyable, primarily due to changes in staff behaviour and management response.
To the management and owner: This feedback is meant to be constructive. Members like myself have provided feedback in the past, but responses often feel generic and unaddressed. Simply directing members to a phone number without real action leaves concerns unresolved.
Here are some of the key issues observed:
1. Member Experience & Capacity: Happy existing members are your best advocates. Smiling ear to ear when signing up new customers is total contrast to sulky cold attitude when help requested by existing customers. Recently, the gym feels overcrowded and noisy, which impacts the workout environment. This has been mentioned in earlier reviews and remains a concern.
2. Cleanliness & Facilities: Toiletries used to be regularly replenished, and hygiene standards were high. Lately, maintenance appears inconsistent. The shower area now has temporary plastic racks on the floor, which adds clutter and feels unhygienic.
3. Noise Levels & Staff Conduct: Music volume is already high, but it is sometimes overpowered by loud conversations at the reception area (staff consistently socialising loudly amongst themselves beyond lunch hours). This detracts from the workout atmosphere.
4. Hygiene Measures: The removal of wet wipe stands has caused inconvenience. Using spray bottles and towels that may not be sanitized adequately raises hygiene concerns. Requests for wipes are often met with a standard “out of stock” dismissive response by Jamie.
5. Equipment Accessibility: Some equipment appears to be stored in restricted-access room. It can be frustrating for members when staff do not readily assist in locating these items. Had a recent bad experience with staff Carmen - unwillingness to help shows in her sulky face.
Lastly, I hope this feedback is taken seriously by the management. The decline in service standards may eventually lead members to seek alternatives. Maintaining a positive, professional environment is key to retaining loyal members.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VLQ0tpcl9IMktYYmV3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Royston Goh,5,"I lost my ring in the gym today, but, Faith and Nadia assisted in helping search the ring all over the gym.

Definitely went way over their job scope, they could have just told me to wait for a call when it has been found, but they actively helped me search and after awhile, they finally found it.

To them, thank you so much for the help!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xsSlZqUmZWek5hUlZGSU5tUTVXakZRZG5oM1gzYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Julian Seow,5,Gym smells really good and is very clean. Staff are friendly and welcoming. The gym has lots of well maintained equipment and a nice functional area to stretch and do other exercises. There’s a drinks making machine which is pretty cool. One highlight of this gym was the family of chickens just outside. Could do with a stairmaster machine to complete my booty blaster workout.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQM3N5Ykp3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Nurul Afiqah,2,"Please read the screen shot of my message to AFBTC as the context to this matter is quite long and as detailed as I can remember.

The response from the AFBTC team was a little disappointing and quite generic. It’s quite sad too that we had such a bad experience at this particular gym because it’s really a nice and great gym. Equipment was mostly well maintained and reminders were put up to clean up after one’s self. My boyfriend and I have yet to get any apology for the insults hurled at us. I’m afraid if you lift heavy,  have the tendency to grunt or make some noise, and you gym in the wee hours, you might be told off as that is considered rowdy behaviour, according to the said couple. I also guess that this is a silent gym and gym etiquette no longer exists. I hope not all the members at this gym are as arrogant and unkind as the couple mentioned.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21acGMxQkllRkU0TTJGM2NXVkZOR2h3YTJvME1XYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Liko Kheh,5,Extremely friendly and dedicated staff. It was a hot day and the AC wasn’t working very well. I pointed out that it was a bit warm and asked if they could switch on more AC’s that were usually kept off. The staff immediately checked all the ACs and started to clean the vents to make sure they worked well. Great equipment and facilities and nice location as well. Highly highly recommend!,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZeXF6TFBnEAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Jsw Chee,5,The friendly staff are the best!

Ashton is particularly helpful. Thank you!,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3dnJPTGJ3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Yen,5,"It has all the features i’m looking for in a gym: a no-fuss atmosphere, access to knowledgable trainers, friendly service (while it’s staffed), new equipment that’s constantly upgraded and maintained, cleanliness.

On top of that, the clientele there is nice, and i never have to wait for a machine during peak periods cos people are willing to rotate.

This branch in particular is very welcoming, including everyone from beginners to the serious power lifters. The fact that i have been consistent with my routine at this branch (4-5 times a week) is a partial testament to how much i  gain from gymming there.

Their training packages are worth it. My regular trainer is Hari, and he’s improved my form heaps. Everyone there’s awesome really.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1eUtIYmZnEAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Carl Chia,5,Great underground gym that’s clean and modern. Cool lighting ambience and friendly staff. Pretty well equipped with 2 deadlift platforms and 4 racks. Dumbbells go up to 50kg.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNicEkzNzJRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Julia,5,"I've been visiting AFBTC for the last two years since its opening for 3-5 times per week, and the gym management has consistently been great at maintaining cleanliness and equipment upkeep. I've been to other AF gyms across Singapore and I can say honestly that this gym has done a great job creating a friendly and conducive environment for working out.

1. Clean area: The cleaners are here daily to keep the space clean, whether it's mopping the floor or wiping down the equipment as needed. There are self-service antibacterial sprays and cloths in every corner of the gym for us to wipe down after each use as well. The toilets are great as well, definitely cleaner than other public ones nearby (yes I've dropped by the gym just to use the toilet before, because Coronation Plaza's toilet is nasty sometimes).

2. Friendly staff: Employees like Carmen, Jamie, and Nadia have been nothing but helpful every time I ask about something. Not sure what's with the complaints from a couple of recent reviews, but RF gyms including AFBTC are literally the only AF gyms where the staff bother greeting you lol.

3. Equipment upkeep: The equipment variety at this gym has been pretty decent considering the size of the gym, and they have everything I need to get a good workout. Sometimes it's a little inconvenient when a couple of machines are down e.g. the one of the treadmills/lat pulldown machine sometimes goes under maintenance for 1 week, but it's still fairly reasonable. They also add new types of machines every few months, which is pretty nice.

4. Respectful gym members: More than 95% of the folks I've met in this particular outlet have been very polite. I've been to gyms where people interrupt you in between sets - none of this BS here. The staff here take gym etiquette seriously and so do the members. Unfortunately there were a couple of times where someone didn't rerack their stuff after working out - hope those people's pillows stay warm on both sides all night.

5. Extra perks: Members' Days are something to look forward to every couple of days per month - I never really remember when they are but when it happens, it's like a surprise reward for coming down to the gym. The main perk I really love about this gym is the female toilet though. It's always well-stocked with sanitary pads in case of any ""emergencies"". It goes to show the extra step they've taken to care for their members. I don't know any non-RF AF gyms that do that. Sure, some commercial gyms offer better perks, but they don't offer the same level of convenience at the same price range.

I'm not being paid to write this, and I didn't use chatgpt for this either. I genuinely enjoy coming to this gym, and I hope they stay around for a longgggg time.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4NThTY1ZBEAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Bryan Bernadind,1,"Beware, This gym appears to be shutting down!

They’ve done away with the purple wet wipe stands, which is a serious hygiene concern—especially with Covid and flu making the rounds again. The tap at the basin has been leaking for ages, and no one seems remotely interested in fixing it. Word has it the cloths used on the machines are washed perhaps once a week, if it is even washed at all?!

Oh, and remember the complimentary fruits on Fridays between 11am and 8pm for Members’ Day? That’s quietly faded that out too. It now randomly appears like a mythical creature.

Staff behaviour leaves much to be desired—not helping to organize the gym for members, asking and pressuring members to make fake review in exchange for old freebies, lengthy smoke and lunch breaks, vaping just outside the entrance (which, let’s not forget, is against the law in Singapore). New hires like Carmen and Bernice seem blissfully unaware of even the most basic standards of customer service. The overall attitude? Utterly lacking in professionalism. The staff often laugh and talk loudly and blast the music. This is very distasteful.

Don’t bother referring a friend—they’re unlikely to honour the free month, regardless of what’s promised.

But then again, it’s hardly a surprise. As one reviewer aptly put it, this is easily one of the worst Anytime Fitness outlets in Singapore. And those glowing reviews? Likely penned by the staff themselves.

Beware everyone and run!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VQem9nOU9FNUxHVXVnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,jane tan,1,"The gym is decent and in a good spot, but it’s often crowded and the music is way too loud.

The real issue? I forgot to update my card details after getting a new one — my bad. But two days after the failed payment, I got pulled aside mid-workout, told to leave, and fined. I’ve been a member for several years, and they couldn’t even let me finish my session?

Even after explaining, the staff insisted I pay immediately via UEN — at 10pm on a public holiday. How was I supposed to get that info then? The staff were clearly just kids so I decided to just walked out.

Really disappointing service with no flexibility at all. A shame, because the gym itself is fine. But I wouldn’t recommend it.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMMm1fOUxHeExiQzFBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Wong Wei Sen,1,"I’ve been to many gyms before, but my experience at Anytime Fitness BTC has been by far the worst. The first thing that stands out is the staff – instead of being approachable or helpful, they are constantly on their phones, eating at the counter, and ignoring members. It feels like they have no interest in assisting guests or maintaining any level of professionalism, which is incredibly frustrating when you’re paying for a membership.

The equipment situation is just as bad. Weights and machines are left scattered all over the place, with no effort to keep things organized or safe. Many machines look poorly maintained, and it gives the impression that management doesn’t care about upkeep at all. On top of that, the air-conditioning is broken, which turns the entire gym into a stuffy, smelly sauna. Instead of being motivating, the environment makes you want to leave as quickly as possible.

The cleanliness is another major issue. The toilets and changing areas are always dirty, with an unpleasant smell that lingers. For a gym that is supposed to promote health and fitness, the level of hygiene is shockingly low.

Overall, this branch feels completely neglected, both by its staff and management. Instead of being a place to focus on training and wellness, it is uncomfortable, unhygienic, and unprofessional. I would never recommend Anytime Fitness BTC to anyone looking for a decent gym experience – it’s disappointing on every single level.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfNm9MeEJREAE

This isn't even the first time they didn't take action. Previously I asked in person for my invoice to be sent to me so I can claim from my company, the staff said ok and got my details. I waited a week, no invoice was sent and I had to bump them for an update again.

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Joel Gwey,5,"I can't say enough positive things about Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central. It's incredibly convenient, just a short 10 minute walk from Botanic Garden MRT station. The gym equipment is top-notch and well maintained, which is a huge plus for me. Despite the slightly smaller size, the cozy and chill atmosphere really adds to the overall experience.

One standout feature is the fantastic music playlist they have. Not only do they play great music, but they also allow members to add their own songs to the shared playlist, something I haven't seen in other Anytime Fitness clubs. This personal touch makes each workout session even more enjoyable.

The staff at AFBTC deserves a special mention. They are incredibly friendly and always greet you with a smile. I had a near miss experience once, and the staff members, Nic and Hyewon, went above and beyond to check in on my well being. It's clear that they genuinely care about providing the best experience for their members.

I highly recommend Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central. It's the perfect gym for those seeking convenience, well-maintained equipment, a cozy atmosphere, and a friendly staff who truly go the extra mile. Five stars without a doubt!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4eS1QeVhBEAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,Thomas Ting,1,"Decent gym, good location however a bit crowded due to relatively small space.

The reason for the one star review however is that I recently renewed my credit card as it is expiring soon. It was my mistake to not inform AF of the new card, and that is my bad.

However while in the middle of the workout I was approached and literally asked to leave because the payment was not charged that month.

I mean, seriously guys? I'm a member for more than two years and you're asking me to leave because the payment is late by two days?

Even after explaining the situation and asked if I can finish the workout first, the brand ambassador asked me to make a payment to the UEN number of the gym I signed up with. At 10pm at night.

Bro idk what you expect me to do sia call up the franchise owner to ask for UEN? At 10pm at night on a public holiday?

I saw that the brand ambassador were literal kids, decided it's not worth trying to talk reason and left.

Terribly disappointing customer service, absolutely no flexibility or thought given to paying member for years. What a blemish on an otherwise good gym.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4MUxpM3dnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah Central,K T (Kelly),1,"""Needs Urgent Improvement! Zero Safety, Organization, and Cleanliness""

I've visited three Anytime Fitness locations in Singapore, and this one is the worst.
This is based on about three months of visiting 2-3 times per week. I will be switching to another location from now on.

The biggest issue is that the owner and staff show no signs of wanting to improve.
If you look at the Google Maps reviews, you'll see that most recent low-rated reviews have no reply from the owner. And when there is a reply, it's just a generic ""Thank you for your feedback"" message. From a user's point of view, nothing is actually improving.

As a result, polite and respectful members are leaving, and only those who need guidance and education remain. That's the real problem.

1. Organization & Cleanliness
Plates are left scattered everywhere after use, and even machine parts are lying around.
Safety bars from benches are not put back, and 20kg barbells lying on the floor seems to be the normal situation here.
The cloths for wiping down machines are always wet and feel unhygienic. I have never seen anyone use them after finishing a machine.
The floor mats near the lat pulldown area are peeling and uneven, which is dangerous. It you cannot fix it right away, at least put up a warning sign.

2. User Manners
Groups of people talking loudly are common (about once every two visits). Their voices are so loud they go through my noise-canceling headphones, which is very distracting.
Also, people do not clean or put equipment back after use. Benches and plates are left out, so the free-weight area often does not have what you need. This means I have to walk between different bench areas to collect plates, which is a waste of time and unsafe.
A bench area with zero 20kg plates? That should never happen.

3. Staff
Staff do greet you, but they do not do enough to keep the gym tidy. Many just sit and scroll on their phones instead of taking action.
They should focus on keeping the gym clean and teaching members basic manners. A few staff pick up abandoned barbells, but most ignore safety and hygiene problems.
Honestly, the owner needs to start with proper staff training.

Bottom line: If you want to train seriously, I do NOT recommend this gym. Go to another Anytime Fitness, even if it's farther away.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21Zd05HVm1TbU4xZFV4SFUwRmFPVXMzTWxwb1VHYxAB
