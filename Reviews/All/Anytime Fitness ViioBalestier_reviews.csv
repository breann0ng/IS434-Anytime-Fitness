Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,Adeline,5,"An Exceptional PT Experience - Highly Recommend Budi!

I rejoined Anytime Fitness (VIIO @ Balestier) in June 2025 and was impressed from the start. The staff were welcoming, and I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of evening classes like Yoga and Calisthenics/HIIT.

The highlight, however, has been my personal trainer, Budi.
I signed up for an introductory 3-session package, and it was an eye-opener. Budi is a cut above the other PTs I've worked with. He expertly taught me how to use the machines, pushed me to my limits safely, and consistently checked on my well-being.
His commitment was so evident that I confidently signed up for 24 sessions. Budi ensures I stay committed to my goals, tracking my progress, diet, and overall well-being. In just over two months, I feel stronger and recently achieved a 20kg deadlift! Thanks to Budi, I am motivated and will soon be able to use the gym confidently on my own. I cannot recommend him highly enough.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21SaFFVTjFZVkZ3ZUVoT09WVXdVVVo0VnpneVdrRRAB

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,JOLENTA LIN,5,"I joined AF Viio @Balestier since day 1 they opened. The equipments are all brand new and the gym is spacious. I enjoyed their classes such as Zumba, kickboxing, and Yoga. I especially loved the personal training sessions with the trainer Ivy. She is really patient and knowledgeable to advise me on what I should do or shouldn’t do. Though now I have moved and could no longer visit the gym, I would definitely recommend this gym and Ivy to you!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJLXMtM3h3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,Kiat Long Tay,5,"My go-to gym  despite not nearest to my house. One of the better branches from the many I've visited.

Spacious, not too crowded. Yet well endowed with 4 barbell racks, and wonderful machines like hip thrust, converging chest press and Incline chest press. Enough seated Lat Pulldowns and Dips for everyone.

Good music and good lighting. Plenty of mirrors. Sanitiser sprays at every corner.

Update: I cannot stand gymgoers who rerack heavy plates on top of small plates. It's like pretending to be considerate but actually creating more trouble for people. They need a mandatory course on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWb2J6RGxnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,Ms.J Hassim,5,"update as of April 2025

the manager has yet to change again, one which was a good front for AF Viio.. and new members have pouring in under his wing.. so I dont see what’s the issue with his leadership…

meanwhile the new members doesn’t seem to have the gym etiquette which existing members have been practising: re-racking weights..

kinda missing the old Viio..

Update:

they’ve taken note and seems they smile now to the gym goers.. kudos to the management that lead the team to greatness!

I’d give them 5 stars if not of the staff friendliness that dropped dramatically. use to feel welcomed and felt like was family albeit being a new face in the hood.. and now the new staffs don’t even look at you when you step in (those that were here before the new set of staffs came in knows). not sure what’s the cause of the change in attitude from the previous staffs and the new ones but not really inclined to visit Viio branch since. Fair stars given for the equipment availability.. they have a big floor space for functional training/warm ups and group class up to 8 pax.. (it’s half of the Harbourfront branch’s open floor if anyone’s been there) cleanliness so-so, it’s clean but not like sparkling clean. it’s a gym after all, but i’m talking bout random hairs on the floors and the gym mats smelling “sour”. thank goodness the toilets are managed by the Viio management itself.
I would not be giving any more star ratings until the guys sitting in front know how to treat customers better. Ya’ll are the face of the gym I think some basic customer service courtesy will improve the gym’s image.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3b0pub0l3EAE

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,Chili Red Arowana,3,"Quite crowded at 7-8pm .. but still have empty machines for me to use. Downside is they don’t have cycling machines, and the treadmill is usually full, at least when I was there.

Upside is, A lot of dumbbell and weights, feels like more than other outlets by 2 or 3 times. Not bad, but only 3 shower cubicles and when I went in I saw people stepped with their dirty shoes on the chairs. Very disgusting..",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiaUpIS1F3EAE

I recently visited this gym and was impressed by the cleanliness and spaciousness of the facility. The gym is well-equipped with sturdy PRECOR and Hammer Strength weights and machines. The staff were professional and friendly, making for a pleasant atmosphere. Even during peak hours, the gym was still tolerable. Overall, I would give this branch a 5-star rating.

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,WanderWithWit,4,"It is a fairly good gym well equipped with some of the best equipment. However from my review of many AF fitness gyms, the bathroom hygiene and hot water issue are definitely two big concerns. I am pretty sure some of us would want to have access to the bathroom with hot water supply. I really don’t want to catch a cold having cold shower. Please do moderate the air ventilation in the bathrooms and air-conditioning around the rest and bathroom areas. Thank you.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4aE5DV2xnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,Jun Tan,4,"Good Points
- Environment: quiet and nice, clean gym. Can tell the owner takes pride in the cleanliness very well.
- Community: music not loud, so everyone also quite tame and quiet and polite. Love it. No obnoxious YPs like at some other AFs.
- Staff: courteous, polite and helpful.
- Equipment: not too bad. There's an abs-crunch machine and a very nice sturdy leg raise machine. Leg machines also not too bad. 4 power racks, 1 or 2 of which often got converted into bench/inclined bench presses. I am actually very very impressed with the amount of attachments they have (v bars, mag-grip bars, ropes, some of which I haven't even seen before).

Bad Points
- Dumbbell Rack: this is my biggest criticism. Right now entire set of dumbbells (10kg to 50kgs) are divided into 2 different areas and we need to cross over to the other side (past the lat pulldowns, tricep extension contraption) to use the (27.5kg+ dumbbells). V inconvenient. Imagine you set up your bench, do a warmup set already with 15kgs, 20kgs, then you have to walk over to the other side to set up another bench to do the 25kgs, 30kgs working set. And each side only has 2 benches (so 4 benches total). Then the gym crowded how?? People just use 1 bench, but carry the dumbbells from 1 area to the other? Or set up 2 benches and use them alternatingly?? Suggest to put all the dumbbells in 1 area and move the deadlift platform to the current less heavy dumbbell area.
- Equipment: minor criticism, but actually we might not need a shoulder press machine AND a shoulder press weight plate-loaded machine. Just 1 to train shoulders is enough? The multiple exercise contraption/jungle gym is useful. But there's one area that's a bit wasted cos it's just another triceps pushdown cable (so 3 tricep pushdown cables in total) - not needed. Also, do we need another separate specific lat pulldown machine - I don't think so cos there's already 2 lat pulldown at the jungle gym area (this owner really like to train lat pulldown ah?).

Wishlist: get more plate-loaded equipment. I think there's space to put more of them in the gym.

Conclusion: overall a very nice pleasant environment with a good polite community and good staff. Average amount of equipment, but with some improvements, it could be a real beast of a gym. Jiayou!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUbDdpUGhBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,mayee lim,1,"This place has absolutely traumatised me by hounding me for fees when in fact I have mentioned very clearly that I wish to terminate my membership.

After informing them on late march that I wanted to cancel my membership, it took them 2 months to tell me that my cancellation was not processed and proceeded to charge me for a late fee.

Reason?

I did not provide a reason for cancellation. For context, they sent this text ""just to follow up on your cancellation request, may we know the reason for cancellation?"" Does this not sound like a post cancellation feedback rather then a confirmation of cancellation?

Even after explaining that this was an absolute miscommunication, they still forced me to pay the past 2 months and late fees in order to process the cancellation.

Ridiculous management.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6cnBxMmVBEAE
Anytime Fitness Viio@Balestier,K Daron,4,"Good gym with high ceiling and large windows. Sufficiently large mirrors.

Their machines are precor brand. Basic array of machines however they could include better machines to differ from other outlets. Something to note is that they do not have a singular cable machine, but they have the jungle cable machine in the center of the gym.

They have 4 power rack and a severely underwhelming deadlift platform which forces you to use the cushions.
I.e block deadlift
!Not advisable to deadlift in this gym!

Weight plates consist of ziva for Deadlift corner and standard anytime fitness plates. Dumbbells are anytime fitness brand and it reaches up to 50kg.

They have accessory equipments like belts for members to use but they are missing a dip belt which i need for heavy weighted dips.

Only have showers in the gym, the toilets are based outside of the gym at the backdoor.

Overall good gym, but its bad if you need to deadlift.

My suggestion for the deadlift, look into getting a larger platform that can spread out the force and has some sort of dampening within it to dissipate the energy.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaN3VfeGV3EAE
