Anytime Fitness,Renee Cutaia,4,"New location! Lots of space to grow, you can tell this is just the first phase of equipment installation. Clean, nice amount of floor space, has racks and lots of free weights. Several showers but I didn’t see toilet ?? Very quiet for now since just opened. Love the location near FairPrice.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xGTlMzcEJSV2hZWm1wNldHUjZiM1I2Ukdnek5WRRAB
Anytime Fitness,J K,2,"Not only is this AF outlet seriously under equipped as another shared, their group class instructors reserve machines for their session, which means their sole rower machine and sole ski machine are taken away from other gym members — and during peak hours too! Ridiculous of management to allow this. When I spoke to the reception staff, they told me to ask the instructor for permission to use the machines. A laughable request, seeing that AF is meant to be an open gym concept. The instructor who “choped” the machines were rude too; she stood around and stared me down until I moved away.

Not only that, some of the machines that are available, are already broken, such as the treadmills with missing buttons. Even when the gym newly opened a month or so ago, the equipments were clearly quite worn down already. It’s fine to have secondhand machines but they should at least be reasonably modern and not broken?!

Utterly disappointing AF outlet.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21GWVIwWjZiRVkwZERZelV5MVhlR2RQVTJaaGQxRRAB
Anytime Fitness,Kay,4,"Definitely not the average Anytime Fitness in the neighbourhood, way more than a average gym.
This nice gym is equipped with 2 dedicated platforms, 2 more weight racks (total 3), 1 smith machine and good variety of weight and cardio machines. And of course, very friendly staff, spacious washrooms + amnesties. However, lack of seated row/lat pull down machine is a big miss (it is an essential)

One thing Depot road AF stands out from all the other AF in Singapore is their massive changing rooms with studio quality lighting - for anyone who practices their competition posing!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pocFlUQjZWMHRpZDFVd1RuTlBOMjlhVkVsbFdsRRAB
Anytime Fitness,Ronald Yeo,1,"Spaciously but seriously under equipped. No machines for pull, no leverage for push, deadlift platform without jack, limit bar set up to 20kg, soft-back leg raise rack, nothing for abs and calf… quite a gap with other AF in this AF contested area.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tKSmJGcEhRMmR2VVZWVVJrUnJWMVphZG5aS1ZFRRAB
Anytime Fitness,zong,5,"depot road residents have been waiting for this the longest time

brand new gym within walking distance

packed with everything you can find in all AF gyms

clean, new and spacious environment, hopefully they will add more machines (another cable machine?)

grooming area looks really good, comes with the vending machine packed with protein snacks too",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tnNFVEVjZhUzExTkZwNUxVRnJSakZ6U3podlNYYxAB
Anytime Fitness,Neil Patrick Cataag,5,"I’ve been training with Firdaus for a while now, and I like how he structures the fitness program. Fir is patient and pays attention to the small details, and adjusts the plan on the spot when needed

A few things that stood out:

Sessions are well-structured and challenging.
Clear tips I can actually use outside the session.
Noticeable progress without feeling overwhelmed.

Highly recommend working and booking training sessions with Fir.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25sdGVqbDJPRmxDTUdJM09EZzJORVJMTkd0TWJHYxAB
Anytime Fitness,Jared Koh,5,"This is one of the nicest AF gyms I’ve ever seen. Well maintained by a team that clearly takes pride in it. The equipment is great, thoughtfully selected and functional - I hear they’re still acquiring more machines. The showers are excellent - soaps provided.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT214RVV6Tm9ZakI1U1dOTlJscDZMWEZrVmxadGFrRRAB
Anytime Fitness,Garyzaldy Calong,5,Finally! A gym that is literally in our neighbourhood and has just about the right equipment for me! Their other equipment will come in a few months time so better check them out! 🙏💪 …,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21GU2RXY3ljV0psV2xWeVJXOUhjemsxYmxFMGQzYxAB
Anytime Fitness,flash kreiger,2,"Spacious gym, lacking machines though. Been here multiple times, never see a single person cleaning up after themselves. Dk how clean/dirty each machine is....",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2kwNFNIaDZORWhmYldsQ2QzcGxaME5WY1dKQ1RuYxAB
