Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,Michael Thein,5,"I’ve had an amazing experience at Anytime Fitness Geylang Central! 💪

Special thanks to Brandon, who has been extremely professional, friendly, and motivating. He always takes the time to guide me with proper techniques and provides great advice on training and lifestyle improvements. His positive energy makes every workout enjoyable and productive.

The gym itself is well-maintained, clean, and equipped with everything you need for a great workout—whether it’s cardio, strength, or functional training. The staff are approachable, and the community here is welcoming and supportive.

Highly recommend this branch and especially Brandon if you’re looking for someone who genuinely cares about your progress and fitness journey. 👏",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21oUWVsaFVlVWt3UzNVMlgzRnBPREl3TUhkRFdIYxAB

Highly recommended!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKUGJVOVNjMkZtUW1KRldsRjRWRmxEVEdocU5tYxAB

Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,Alexander Aaltonen,5,"Recently opened AF outlet, must say one of the best ones around! Good variety of equipment and machines.

Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,Lucien Lim,5,"Spacious, new (as of April 2023) branch of AF that is well equipped and maintained. It has 3 racks (cages) and a smith machine allowing for ample usage opportunities.

It’s located on the fourth floor, with elevators accessible at the back (right hand side) of the supermarket. The toilet is not attached, so gym goers would have to leave the gym to use the loo (on the same floor).",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSN2UtYkJnEAE
Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,Jeremy Chan,5,"I’ve taken it upon myself to check out the Anytime Fitness gyms around my residence(Tanjong Rhu) @ I’m glad to say this gym definitely deserves 5 stars. Apart from the entire gym having full windows on all the walls so you have a panoramic view whilst working out, it also has sufficient equipment for an amazing workout.

AF @ Chai Chee still has the most amount of equipment I would say, but this gym, like I said, is more than adequate to enjoy a thorough workout. Closer to me too! :)

Equipments are all new & in pristine condition, gym is clean & pretty large for AF standards(slightly smaller than AF Chai Chee. Check this gym out guys. 5 stars for sure.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkemF6QXdnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,Jack Chan,2,"Overall a very nice gym and the equipments are complete. place is kept clean as well.

Only issue I had was one of this member in this photo. For regular AF Geylang Central members, you will recognise this person. Narcissistic rude member who ask for dumbells and machines when i was halfway through my workout.

When he comes with his wife, you will see their motorbike gears hogging the shelves. And they’re never seem to wear pants their age.

Now they have moved to AF Guillemard, I might be back more often at AFGC ☺️",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzeHE3cFJnEAE

Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,tarlo gill,5,"I chanced upon this gym while on my way back home from office. The space and equipment here are larger than the other AF gyms I visited, so that's definitely something worth noting. Shout out to the team, especially Cory, for providing a free trial and walking through the space in detail. One advantage of this gym is its well-maintained equipment, with plenty of racks and deadlift spots for compound movement. This reduces the waiting time significantly. While you run, the threadmill offers a view of the busy street life outside, so you're sure not to be bored. The shower facilities and bag storage are conveniently located in the middle of the gym, ensuring a hassle-free showering experience. All in all, it's worth checking this place out!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMLW9EbDVnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,daniel,3,"The gym is generally well-equipped. To cater to powerlifters, considering adding powerlifting bars alongside the existing deadlift platforms would be beneficial. The functional area impresses with its assortment of bands and rollers for warm-ups. Enhancements could include introducing a wider range of 5-25kg plates for members. Improving the restroom experience by ensuring better air freshening could be appreciated. Lastly, increasing the availability of sanitizers and encouraging the use of towels for equipment cleaning instead of tissues would enhance convenience.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENWIyVVlBEAE

its alittle hidden but not hard to get to
always clean and i guess being alittle hidden helped so it was never too crowded. cardio machines are all facing the windows facing the trees, nice for zoning out hehe
only down side is no toilet inside the gym itself and the crazy amount of supper options when you come out of the gym that helps you kiss your workout session goodbye XD",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxeXBhdjhRRRAB

Didn’t wanted to sign me in since he started his seance (16mins late minus the one I spent waiting on the door).

Anytime Fitness Geylang Central,W L,1,Horrible customer service by the staff there. The hotline lady seemed to be super skeptical and made a lot of sarcastic comments like “ you sure or not?” When I told her I just moved in to Geylang . Super irritating lady to mend the customer service hotline when I wanted to try out the club as I just moved in. I suggest to please train her properly or switch to another person to handle the customer hotline because her being sarcastic or not believing customers like as if they are lying is very bad rep for you guys.

The gym charges SGD 25 for a single entry. It is located on the second floor. It has all the necessary equipment. There are not many people at noon on weekdays. The equipment is well maintained. There is drinking water inside. There are also vending machines in the shower room. It is recommended for those who are in Singapore but want to find a single gym.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQNWVyMkp3EAE
