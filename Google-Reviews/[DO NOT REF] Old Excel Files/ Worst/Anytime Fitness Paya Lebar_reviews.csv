Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Joe Lim,1,"Poorly maintained gym. Security wise, more than a handful of lockers are broken or in disrepair. Rowing machine spoilt. Soap dispenser empty. Missing or incomplete dumbells. It is such a sad state for members to use. I also cannot comprehend how they will entice new members to join. Seems the gym owners are blind to these faults or they are not bothered to repair.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Durrah Rafi,1,"Very disappointed with Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar. A payment failed due to a bank issue beyond my control, yet I was still charged a late fee. When I reached out for help, the gym dismissed my concerns and pushed all responsibility onto me. Their response showed no empathy or willingness to support a paying customer.

If you value fair treatment, I would not recommend this branch. Other Anytime Fitness locations provide better management and customer service, save yourself the frustration.

This was the response I got from them when I asked for help:
“Good morning, if the issue is due to bank , then bank should bear this extra cost incurred to you and do the needful from their end. Hope you understand our side that just like you, we, AFPL can not bear this extra cost either as its not even our fault.”

As a paying customer, I had expected more understanding and support from the gym. Definitely not continuing my membership here after this experience.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Potato,1,"The shower doesn't have hot water, and after aerobic exercise, you can only use cold water. The drastic change in body temperature can cause blood vessels to contract too quickly, posing a risk. Additionally, the equipment is outdated, and the water from the dispenser has a strange taste. I strongly recommend going to another place; this one is completely unacceptable.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Hung Hao,4,"Mixed feelings- this is an awesome place for those hustling for a narly leg pump. With a myriad of leg day machines, even the famed Hack Squat, I would love to come here for a leg day workout!

There is certainly more than enough machines here to tickle any fancy. I think that it is rather spacious, and also I went at the peak and did not find it crowded.

Another plus point would be the two vending machines, one with purely drinks, and another one with more protein based beverages.

However, there are certain things that I found lacking.

Firstly, free weight dumbbells only go up to the maximum weight of 40kg, and surprisingly, the pair of 37.5kgs were missing.  Colour me confused, as I expected dumbbells to usually hit about 50kg in max weight. Not that I use those, but still, probably important for the big guy right?

Secondly, the toilet seemed rather dirty when I used it. Again, not the end of the world and certainly not a reflection of the outlet. But it would be nice to figure that out.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Reno Chai,3,"-0.5 star for gym members always not re-racking properly. Even when people do re-rack, they do it for the sake of re-racking to show they re-rack, in the picture you can see that I often have to go through multiple plates of 20kg to get to a lighter plate :)

-0.5 star star for not having dedicated benching Station, the ones here people kept have to readjust the seat and stuff...

-1 star for not fixing or replacing broken equipment like the pulldown machine bar shown in the picture... its super uncomfortable and its been broke for at least 4months now...

If I could take another half a star off I would, but google review only can +-1 😉
--------------------------------

Updates, the broken pulldown machine bar has been replaced to a new one right after I write this review ;) coincidence? I think not :)",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,LS Nosaj,5,"First time visit this gym at around 8am in the morning just now, unexpectedly clean.

Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Jung Ro,1,"Usually, when you first register, they say you have to buy a key, so I paid money and bought it, and when I said I wanted to cancel, they said I had to pay for two months, so I paid, but when I tried to return the key, they said they couldn't refund it. When I asked why it wasn't possible, they said they couldn't give it to me because I don't exercise much. When I asked why they kept charging me when I didn't exercise, the manager's response was very slow and very rude. Please be aware of this and choose the Paya Lebar branch.
ps. how you guys doing business like this? amazing.....",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Nathanael Khoo,5,"It's a nice gym to workout in. It's near my workplace so it's really convenient for me.

Toilets are clean. Shower area is clean. The gym is spacious and it has machines for all muscle groups. (Especially legs).

Staff is friendly, greets you when you enter and leave.

The music is always upbeat and keeps me motivated throughout my workouts. (All I Do Is Win by DJ Khaled always pumps me up)

Overall, good vibes.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Stephen H,1,"Avoid this gym branch if you can, seriously. I'm already regretting it. First, they charge you a late payment admin fee of 14$ if your online monthly payment fails even once, even if you try to resolve on the same day.

Another negative point is ""customer service"". Mr. Zacky, the manager of the branch, has some severe attitude issues, and is very rude/unfriendly. You may want to be careful when approaching him. He had complained to me about how understaffed his branch is and how he is preparing for some competition, to which I said that he would need some help. His answer was ""you mean I need mental help?"". Something just seems wrong here, doesn't it?

Only plus side is 24-hour availability of the gym, and somewhat decent equipment. But with the above experience, I'll think of cancelling and getting out of this place as soon as I can.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Jeremy Chan,3,"Tried this gym out for the 1st time today. Wasn’t thoroughly impressed. The equipment are old & outdated, albeit to be frank they are still in working order & can still be used. Cables are lacking IMO though. They don’t even have the wide double cables ubiquitous in most gyms for you to do wide cable flies(flys) for you chest etc.

Probably wouldn’t go to this gym again unless for some reason I’m really reaaaally close by. But then again the Geylang Central AF is also close by and 1 I prefer.

The AFs @ City Hall & Chai Chee are also pretty close by and they have a wider variety of equipment that are also more contemporary. They are both also larger than the Payar Lebar AF.

If Payar Lebar AF does a revamp like update their equipment(yes, this gym’s highest dumbbells are 40kg, definitely too low for a major gym.), & also IMO repaint the entire gym as the colours in the gym honestly don’t help the ambience, this gym could be a winner.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Yeo Kai Wen,4,"Clean and spacious gym when you visit during off-peak hours. Be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours after 5pm - the gym is relatively small and has limited equipment for sharing. If there were more than 15 people in the gym I think I would have to head elsewhere for my workout. Lighting was good, machines were relevant and sufficient for my workout plan. Toilets - there are 3 toilets, 2 of which are unisex and 1 reserved for females.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Joseph Silenzio,3,"Stuffy, esp at dumbbell area as the gym doesn't switch on all their air conditioners.

Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,sasha queenie,3,"I like this gym but there are a few issues. The area is huge but they did not utilize the space well. For example, the dumbbell area: they could easily put another rack of dumbbells beside the existing one. Move the barbells away; the mirrors are already built. Now the barbells are blocking the mirrors. Another issue, do not go before 10 am. It is super hot. Like a sauna. What a waste.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,pR2O H3Uf,1,"Worst owner management at this branch. The aircon is off between 22:00 and 10:00 but the gym is supposed to be 247 they are too stingy too much cost cutting when we pay too much for the membership fees anyway. And the ceiling is always leaking on your head in the weights area. And there’s a cockroach infestation under the carpet! It’s disgusting. And the staff that sit at the door to make sure you take your temperature etc are nasty, they are not friendly.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Hanneke Leijdekkers,2,"Nice equipment's, 24/7 open, but NOT 24/7 air-conditioning!!?

2019: Still no air-conditioning!!! Very bad!!!
And this time no music at all.... not nice to do you workout in this environment.

2018: The music is good now and they do have cleaning wipes! 👍
But it's very hot in this gym. Hopefully they will manage this too! 😀💪
Alas they can't manage, they say... The aircon is central for the whole mall and starts just at 10 am. But they have there own aircons, but they are switched off. Why can the neighbors (Evolve) do it and Anytime can't?
It was my favorite gym in Singapore, but due to the heat not anymore.

2017: Nice gym!
Clean and nice (and a lot of different) equipment's!
I'll sure come back when I am in Singapore again. 👍

Anytime Fitness Paya Lebar,Aaron Thor,3,"This is a Covid period review. I gave 4/5 before way before covid even started.

Nowadays, I noticed members don't even wipe off and clean after using the equipments. Bench, machines or handle attachments on the cable machine. Sweat all over...

There is even a member got the balls to tell me why bother cleaning?... Some members don't even bring the towel too.

I think the Staffs gotta tighten up on this and ensure members wipe equipment, bring own towel, check vaccinated status, use hand sanitizer before entering the gym.

Everyone gotta play a part to end this thing. Don't really wanna see another lockdown and all we can blame is ourselves for being irresponsible.",Date not found
