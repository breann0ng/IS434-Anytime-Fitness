Anytime Fitness NEX,Wong Yi Hao,1,"Super run down, many members but management not doing bare minimum to keep the place in order. Don’t even provide resistance bands, don’t allow members to eat at the rest area.
Dumbbell area super disheveled, ground is uneven. Feedback more than 2 years ago but gym manager says ‘upper management’ has yet to approve the renovation.
Equipment is always rusty and dusty as well.
Do NOT sign with this gym.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness NEX,Ernz Lim,1,"Super duper crowded during peak hour, everything is being used, machines and equipment are the most rundown I’ve ever seen at any AF gym. The weights are all without numberings and they can’t bare to replace them and resort to using a piece of paper to write the numbers on it.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness NEX,Aileen Vitug,1,"Anytime Fitness NEX has been one of the most disappointing gym experiences I've ever had. Despite the 24/7 access being advertised as a major perk, the facility is often overcrowded, there's a queue in using the equipment during peak hours, making it nearly impossible to get a decent workout. Equipment is frequently out of order, and the machines that do work are either outdated or poorly maintained. Cleanliness is another major issue – sweat-streaked benches, dirty floors  are regular occurrences.

The staff seems indifferent at best; they're hardly ever available for help and, when they are, they’re not very welcoming. I signed up and their staff, Grace, promised my partner 1 free month of membership for referring me. She assured us this even if we didn't ask for it but at the end she denied ever saying it, because we didn't have any proof, so we cannot also trust the staff keeping their word. I regret having signed up in this gym, I don't like being lied to.

Anytime Fitness NEX feels like a rip-off and far from the good experience they claim to provide. I’d recommend looking elsewhere if you’re serious about your fitness. Before making a mistake of signing up on this branch.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness NEX,Roger Thomas Tan,5,Great place at NEX! Spacious with lots of machines to use! Other users are friendly and willing to share machines!

Anytime Fitness NEX,Alan Ang,1,"Just recently signed up with AF and went to quite a few branches for the past months. By far, the branch at Serangoon Nex is in the worst condition. They even need to use markers to indicate the weight of the dumbells. Extremely overcrowded most peak hours but that's understandable. That being said, it is well equipped for an all round workout. I would suggest the franchisee to make an effort to replace all the dumbells and update some of the equipments. IT DOESN'T COST MUCH! No photos, not worth taking any.",Date not found

Ive been a member since dunno how many years. The club urgently needs a makeover, new equipment, renovated toilets (with new everything).

These days, seems like management don't care about the facilities. What happened guys? I keep on seeing young ones training with crocs and not reracking their weights and nobody cares!

Anytime Fitness NEX,Minh Nguyen Le,1,"Worst AF in Singapore I have ever been to. Staffs are unfriendly, not helpful and don’t look very healthy and fit ( I would never hire them to coach me ). Equipments are old and rusty.
I was 32 weeks pregnant and tried to hit the gym whenever I feel like I can. My mind is all over the place and my feet were swelling. In addition, I planned to just training my core with very light dumbbells at the stretching area that day. Therefore the last thing I want to do is training in my small, tight pair of converse shoes. It was fine with staffs at other AF because I mostly just stretch and exercise with yoga mat at the designated areas and only use light dumbbells for 1 exercises. The staff approached me and ask me to leave if I don’t have any cover shoes. What a horrible experience when you are trying to exercise while being pregnant! I didn’t let that ruins my exercise routine. I just go downstairs and buy me an another comfortable and casual pair of cover shoes and finished my exercises. I was too tired of my pregnancy to deal with the service yet.
In summary , I don’t think I will be back or purchase any services there any rime soon since there are a lot of choices around that areas. Serangoon garden, or upper Serangoon or Lorong Chuan.
Why putting myself in a dark cold, old and rusty, unfriendly and not supportive environment especially when I am a pregnant woman in my last trimester.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness NEX,Shannon Lim,1,"been here for quite sometime and have always been wearing covered shoes, but one day i decided to drop by before work to do some upper body weights work out but this staff called jack confronted me for wearing boots. saying it’s “not sport shoes” i understand it’s a gym but what i don’t understand is converse, vans or other casual covered shoes are allowed.

this boots im wearing covers my feet so well, it basically protects all 10 toes. the problem is not me getting told to wear sport shoes but he speaks in this very condescending tone—flat out rude.

i never had issues with covered shoes when visiting other AF, and staff in other outlets are always super nice, friendly and welcoming.

Anytime Fitness NEX,Emmanuel Goh,1,"been to many AF (the tampines central one is great - there’s ALWAYS someone who waves you in and the staff there make an effort to keep the place safe and welcoming).

the staff at Nex leave much to be desired - every interaction is unpleasant and they do little to create any type of community/culture. clearly they’re here to do the bare minimum and it shows. the upkeep of the place is horrendous (look at the tons of other reviews pointing out faulty parts, rusty weights, etc etc), and the layout of machines/benches is quite thoughtless wrt maximising an easily overcrowded space.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness NEX,Cassandra Goh,1,"Staff/PTs are unhelpful and unfriendly.

Asked one of the PTs for help with adjusting one of the machines and he simply told me that “I don’t manage this area of the gym hence I don’t know and anyways most people don’t need adjusting of this machine”. AF please make sure your PTs are at the very least competent to help members with the machines?? This is quite ridiculous imo.

On another note, staff at the front desk is not friendly at all (as many other reviewers have noted) and do not even bother to say hi/acknowledge members who are entering (unlike other AFs).

I strongly believe that people make up the gym community and for this AF, you’re way better off asking the regulars for help than the supposedly trained staff.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness NEX,Justin Woo,5,"Huge and spacious gym — high ceiling clearance makes for a less claustrophobic environment despite the huge variety of machines and free weights.

Toilets and bag areas are generally well cleaned even during non-staffed hours. Good security as well (key fob access system), with CCTV monitoring the bag areas.

There are also plenty of protein shakes and bars available for purchase via vending machines.

Anytime Fitness NEX,Bryce Lim,1,"The service here for membership is preposterous. The staff whatsapped me the rates, and when I went down physically they told me the rates and both were the same: it was 12 or 18 monthly and the rates were paid monthly, but if you pay in lump sum you will get 1 month free. However in the end, when I was about to confirm they told me only lump sum option available (in a take it or leave it manner) and no reply after I asked why the offer was different from the original conversations I had.
How can you offer different prices at different times at your whimsy and as a customer I just find the service to be terrible. Will not sign up with this gym and found a much better gym elsewhere. My guess is that they have enough capacity for members and don’t value new members hence the treatment.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness NEX,Joel Gwey,1,"I have been a member at Anytime Fitness Nex for a while now, and while I appreciate its convenient location, I must say that the overall condition of the gym could use some improvement.

One of the main issues I have noticed is the maintenance of the equipment. Many of the dumbbells and machines show signs of rust, which is not only unsightly but also raises concerns about their durability and safety. Additionally, the deadlift platforms have noticeable dents, which can affect the proper execution of exercises.

Another area that needs attention is the air conditioning system. The gym tends to be excessively humid, making each session more uncomfortable than it should be. I find myself breaking out in sweat excessively, which hampers my workout experience. Adequate air ventilation would greatly alleviate this issue.

Furthermore, the ventilation in the men's restroom leaves much to be desired. There is a persistent unpleasant smell that seems to linger, making it an unpleasant experience for users. Addressing this issue would greatly improve the overall hygiene and comfort of the facilities.

Considering my experiences at other Anytime Fitness locations, I believe Anytime Fitness Nex could benefit from upgrading their equipment to meet the standards found at other branches. Members deserve well-maintained and modern equipment to enhance their workouts.

I hope that management takes these concerns into consideration and makes the necessary improvements to create a more enjoyable environment for all members.",Date not found

incredibly grateful to the Anytime Fitness Nex team. signed up with them through Richard and started my fresh gym journey in Aug 2022. have been having continuous PT sessions with Jack and it really made my gymming a million times more enjoyable. for someone who has never had proper gym experience, not only did Jack helped boost my confidence in gymming, but made me realise that it's really okay to have down times sometimes and i shouldn't hate myself for it 😭 on top of the entire AF Nex team who has been super friendly and nice, special shout out to Hakim and Zul!! 🫶🏻 this gym's team has rly made me feel so comfortable and unafraid to gym alone 😩 forever thankful 🥹

I went twice and waited for 20-30 mins, I then went in (someone else also waiting in let me in) and figured out everyone was sitting in a room, chit-chating with complete disregard to everyone standing outside waiting for the front office desk employee. They are not clear to explain anything and force you to join a package that suits the front office guy. The follow questions had a lead time of 1 day!(Imagine a sales guy taking 1 day to respond to potential new customer query, they are just not interested in your business)
