Anytime Fitness Havelock Outram,Edy fawzi Md taip,5,"This gym is a very conducive place to work out, with friendly staff who are super kilat. Visited this gym a few times, and overall, I’m really happy with my experience.

One of the best things is the 24/7 access, which is a huge plus for my unpredictable schedule. The gym is always clean, well-maintained, and never feels overcrowded. It’s a great environment that motivates me to keep coming back.

Big kudos to all the Havelock Outram staff for doing such a great job—you all really make the place feel welcoming and well-run. Highly recommended!",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Havelock Outram,Jeremy Chan,4,"1st time coming to this gym & honestly the ambience & atmosphere is nice. Not 1 of the biggest AFs in SG but nowhere close to a small AF as well, somewhere in between. It’s located literally IN Furama Hotel which is pretty nice location wise.

They have quite a range of equipment but nowhere close to what I’d like to play around with as a long time weightlifter. However, it’s definitely adequate for a good workout. Downside is that the free weights/dumbbells section is really small & narrow, but thankfully not many people using it @ a time. TBH the gym wasn’t too packed @ all giving you space!

Definitely a nice AF gym!",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Havelock Outram,Nina Natasha Hamidi,5,"The staff is friendly and helpful, especially during staffed hours, and the gym has a welcoming, non-intimidating atmosphere. It's not overcrowded, which means I rarely have to wait to use equipment. I also appreciate the global access to other Anytime Fitness locations, which is great for travel.

If there’s one downside, it’s that the size of the gym and the range of amenities can vary greatly depending on the location. Some locations are more spacious and better equipped than others, so it's worth checking out your local branch before signing up.
Overall, I'd recommend Anytime Fitness to anyone looking for a convenient, no-frills gym with flexible hours and a supportive community vibe.",Date not found

Rating: ★★★★★

I have been a member at Anytime Fitness gym for over a year now, and I can confidently say that it has been an exceptional fitness experience. This gym has truly exceeded my expectations in terms of its facilities, services, and overall atmosphere.

First and foremost, the gym's 24/7 access is a game-changer. It allows me to work out whenever it suits my schedule, whether it's early in the morning, late at night, or even during holidays. This flexibility has been a massive advantage, especially for someone with a busy lifestyle like mine.

The facilities at Anytime Fitness are top-notch. The gym is spacious, well-maintained, and equipped with a wide range of state-of-the-art exercise machines, weights, and cardio equipment. The cleanliness and organization of the entire facility are remarkable, ensuring a comfortable and hygienic workout environment.

What sets Anytime Fitness apart from other gyms is its friendly and knowledgeable staff. The trainers are approachable, professional, and always ready to assist with any questions or concerns. They offer personalized guidance and create customized workout plans to help members achieve their fitness goals effectively and safely.

Another aspect that I appreciate about Anytime Fitness is the diverse range of group classes they offer. From yoga and Zumba to HIIT and cycling, there is something for everyone. These classes are led by experienced instructors who offer motivation and challenge members to push their limits while ensuring proper form and technique.

The gym's focus on member safety and security is also commendable. The facility is equipped with surveillance cameras, emergency buttons, and a secure access system, making me feel safe during my late-night workouts. Additionally, the gym strictly follows COVID-19 safety protocols, providing hand sanitizers, enforcing social distancing, and regularly sanitizing equipment.

Anytime Fitness also offers a convenient mobile app that allows members to track their workouts, join challenges, and access workout routines. This technology integration is a great addition to the overall gym experience, making it easier to stay motivated and on track with fitness goals.

Lastly, the membership fees at Anytime Fitness are reasonable, especially considering the quality of facilities and services provided. They also offer various membership options, including month-to-month plans, family plans, and corporate discounts, catering to a diverse range of individuals.

Overall, Anytime Fitness gym has proven to be a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a well-rounded fitness experience.

Anytime Fitness Havelock Outram,Celene Javier,1,"January 14 2025 around 9am-10am

What used to be my most favorite anytime fitness outlet in singapore, has been soured by the staff working that day and time.

I was using the rack with plates on it for the bench press. And after my set I was going to the toilet for a few seconds and was not done yet with the barbell and bench.
The staff there confronted me with a pissed off voice telling me “are you going to re-rack the plates or not?”
This staff could have said this to me in a more pleasing and respectful way, i dont see any reason why he was very rude.

I told him “im not done using it yet”
He then looked more pissed and replied to me with “then put your bottle on the bench then”
I was really taken a back with how this staff spoke to me and how rude he was.

On my way out I asked for his name and he said his name was “Abdullah” though im not 100% sure if it really is his name.

Suggest to management to have prorated gym membership fees based on the date of keyfob collection and not 16/2/24 as Anytime Fitness was not able to uphold the agreement on their end to allow clients to have a keyfob to access other AF gym at start of membership.
