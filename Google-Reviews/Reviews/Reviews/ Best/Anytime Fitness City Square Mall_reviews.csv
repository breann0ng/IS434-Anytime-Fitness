Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Justin Hoyo,5,"One of the better anytime fitness outlets in Singapore’s by far. The gym is extremely spacious, well-equipped, and well maintained. It’s location within city square mall which is convenient from MRT. There’s a total of six power racks and two smith machines. Cable stations are also available. They also have dedicated changing room/toilet area.

Would be willing to travel here on the weekends. I would assume weekday evenings will be packed. Come and check this gym out! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",2 months ago,September 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25nM09YRTFRMHR5UlU1RFpteE5TRGhKTVdwTFlrRRAB

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Jane Jha,1,"• Gym's sanitizer spray are often empty, making it difficult to maintain hygiene.

• The wiping cloth provided are consistently dirty, dusty, and have a strong odor. Wet wipes dispenser are always empty

• Members are forced to bring their own wipes because hygiene is essential, yet the gym doesn't supply these basic necessities.

• Despite a rule requiring members to sanitize equipment after use, basic cleaning supplies are not provided.

• Despite paying monthly fees, we are expected to supply our own cleaning materials, and the equipment is frequently dusty and poorly mentained

I am sharing my experience here because submitting feedback through the QR code provided doesn’t seem to reach management. Nothing has changed, and only getting worse.",7 months ago,April 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJN05IMHhnRRAB

Special mention to Daryl who took the time to run me through some of the equipment despite me being rather lost and intimidated by all the muscly men and women there. He was patient and knowledgeable and I honestly thought he was a PT.

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Kiat Long Tay,5,"Of the many AF outlets I've been to, this one is 5 stars. First, with 6 powerlifting racks, 2 Smith machines, and 3 dual-cable machines, I don't ever have to worry about being too crowded and having to queue for machines. Second, it's clean! And tidy - all handles, clips, spray bottles etc are all placed in small baskets around the gym. There's enough racks for each weight plate, so I don't have to ""play the Tower of Hanoi"" every time. Third, with two pairs of every dumbbell in 2.5kg increments, and a separate rack just for 25kg red plates, surely got enough weights for everyone.",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkcmVEVWtRRRAB

Cleanliness - 1/5

I just go during early morning so that dont have to see the lazy and useless staff. Hope management can hire someone with some professional attitude who can actually help instead of just sitting and the only answer the staff have for all problem is “what can i do?” Or “i dont know”

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Shihao Foo,5,"My favourite gym for a late night chill workout. The gym is relatively new and so the equipment and facilities are clean and fresh. The lighting isn’t too bright either. Overall the decor has the relaxing vibes of a bar.

+ve: training wise, it also has some less common machines that other AFs don’t have. For example, its assisted pullup machine is of the standing type (unlike the more common kneeling type). They also provide a helpful chart of their crowd levels at different times of the day (busiest between 7-9+pm on weekdays).

-ve: the biggest downside for me is that the gym has a no chalk policy, hence i only come for less intense workouts where i will not need chalk. Another point is that although the gym is well equipped, somehow I was not able to find a single abs crunch machine.

Finally as a more neutral point, for folks looking to train their glutes, i initially couldn’t find a booty builder machine here, but then I realised they have an equivalent called “glute drive”. To me, the booty builder looks more aesthetic, but this equivalent looks functionally similar. Have not tried it though.",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqLUpQQnd3RRAB

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Kid Carter Wagang,5,"Visited twice during my vacation in SG. I went at around 6/7am on Saturday and Monday. The place was relatively empty at that time except for a probably around 5/6 people. The place was big with an array of exercise equipment.

What amazed me was the abundance of sanitizer and towels, I think there is one for every machine. The shower area was also stocked with deodorant, for those just in case moments.

My mind was blown by the fact that they have supplement vendo machines.

Gym cleanliness: 10/10

I really enjoyed my first time experience at AF! I was first greeted by staff member Daryl Lim and was arranged for an hour of free trial. I was keen to lose fat and gain muscle, but was completely new to the gym. Daryl was kind and helpful, he guided me around the gym and assisted me with some exercises that left me aching and sweating. Needless to say, it was a fulfilling experience, and I signed up for a membership on the spot.

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Dhaval Bhate,1,"Extremely disappointed with the experience at Anytime Fitness City Square Mall. I was overcharged on two separate occasions and despite having written confirmation from their own staff about billing adjustments, the team has refused to take responsibility or apologise.
They have been completely dismissive and unhelpful throughout the process. Instead of acknowledging their own mistake, they shifted the blame and brushed off all accountability once I transferred clubs. Even when presented with clear proof, they showed no willingness to resolve the issue or support a long-time member. This is not about the money. It is about how a business chooses to treat its members when things go wrong. The lack of basic professionalism, follow-through, and courtesy has been incredibly disappointing.
I would not recommend this location to anyone who values proper service and accountability.",3 months ago,August 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xGSFMxZFhVVUZXYjBvNGNUTnlYMlo1Y0dSTGNsRRAB

Easily you end up wasting 30-40 mins in just waiting per visit to get a chance to use the equipments. Even treadmills are busy and there is just 1 cycle. Not just that, half of the cardio equipments are almost always under maintenance. Disappointing.",Edited 3 months ago,August 2025,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQNWNqRWZBEAE

There are no wet wipes available, the towels are dirty and smelly, and most of the spray containers aren’t working properly or are empty. It’s unclear what the staff is doing,  it seems like they’re more focused on gathering 5-star reviews  rather than actually improving the gym’s facilities.

Reading all the glowing reviews here honestly feels misleading. There’s been no noticeable improvement since the gym opened. I really hope the staff and management are more transparent about the reviews. It feels like they’re deceiving people into thinking the gym is efficient and well-run, when in reality, the focus seems to be on collecting ratings rather than addressing the issues that matters!

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Vynsnt Ymmnwl,3,"Review: Inefficient Shower Allocation

The gym has a rather puzzling issue with the shower stall setup at this gym. Despite having more male members than female, and a consistent trend of more men being present at any time of the day, the shower facilities seem disproportionately allocated. Out of four stalls, two are reserved exclusively for women, while the remaining two are designated as unisex.

This arrangement leads to clear inefficiencies. The two female-exclusive stalls often appear underutilized, while the unisex stalls—used primarily by men due to their majority—tend to experience overcrowding and longer wait times. It feels like an unfair allocation of resources, where half of the facilities are reserved for a smaller demographic, leaving the majority to share the rest.

A more logical approach would be to allocate three stalls as unisex and one exclusively for females, or to adopt a dynamic system that adjusts based on demand during peak hours. It’s a shame, as the gym overall offers great amenities, but this lack of consideration for actual usage patterns detracts from the experience. A simple adjustment could make things much more equitable and efficient for everyone.",10 months ago,January 2025,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2dy1la0xBEAE

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Olivia,5,"Though this is not my home gym, this is definitely my favourite AF gym out of all the AF gyms I've tried. I came here because I found out on TikTok that this gym has the calf raise machine which my home gym does not have. On top of having a wide variety of well-maintained equipment, the gym is spotlessly clean and very spacious. Towels and alcohol sprays can be easily found, but they also provide wet tissues to wipe down equipment. The toilets are clean, and they even have a hair dryer and a hygiene corner. They also provide a charging station with a multi charging cable and Wi-Fi. I come here at night and the view from the gym is an added bonus. This would definitely be my top choice for a home gym if I was staying nearby. If I had to name one thing that I would love to see here, it would be 10-20 kg straight barbells and 9kg dumbbells. :)",Edited a year ago,November 2024,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cDh2NkdREAE

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Ryan Chan,1,"Experienced a group of rude gym users demanding their use of equipment during peak hours and would have appreciated if staffs were more proactive on the ground, especially during peak hours, and recovery service after the incident was informed to one of the staff. This review is posted since I've yet to receive any updates from the staff after 5 days.

The incident happen on 30/4/24 between 7.25pm to 7.30pm at the caged rack located near to the Plated Leg Press. As the bench within the rack was empty with no sign of ""booking"" of the equipment such as placing of towel or phone on the bench, I went ahead to use it and completed 2 warm-up sets with no interference. 2 guys came to me after saying that they were using the bench. I politely told them that it was empty when I came to use and that there were no signs of anyone ""booking"" it and if they could use another empty bench that were located beside the Plated Chest Press machine. One of the guys rudely replied ""No"" and continued to give unreasonable reasoning as to how the bench was theirs. I did not want to cause a scene as I was clearly communicating with someone who isn't rationale and clearly egoistic. I offered to clean the equipment since I've used it but they rejected and laughed it off.

This incident was later communicated to a short Malay female staff and I requested her to investigate in this matter and get back to me regarding the resolution to such behavior within the facility and left my contact details with her. Given the benefit of doubt that the next day was Labour Day, I was expecting a response the day after. It has been 5 days since thus I decided to write this review with regards to both the standards of discipline within the gym as well as the proactiveness of the staff in this situation. I hope this group of individuals are not terrorizing other gym users with their unreasonable gym ethics else I would foresee more poor reviews in the future given the fact that this gym, in terms of equipment and staff politeness, are well above average.

For users who have seen this review and wonder if there's anything that can be done during such incident of unreasonable demands, I would highly suggest you to approach the gym staff immediately to sound it off.",a year ago,November 2024,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqemNPLUJnEAE

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Rainer Ong,5,"As a fitness enthusiast eager to maintain a healthy lifestyle, I recently decided to join Anytime Fitness at City Square Mall. Little did I know that this decision would not only positively impact my health but also provide me with exceptional service that exceeded all my expectations.

My journey with Anytime Fitness began with a warm welcome from the staff as soon as I entered the gym. Their friendly demeanor and willingness to assist made me feel right at home. The atmosphere was inviting, with state-of-the-art equipment neatly arranged, creating a motivating environment for a workout.

One aspect that truly stood out to me was the personalized attention I received from the trainers. Unlike other gyms where you are just another number, at Anytime Fitness, the trainers took the time to understand my fitness goals and tailored a workout plan specifically for me. Their expertise and constant encouragement not only pushed me to work harder but also helped me achieve results I had only dreamt of before.

Moreover, the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities at City Square Mall were impeccable. The gym was spotless, equipment well-maintained, and hygiene standards were top-notch. This attention to detail not only reflected the professionalism of the staff but also ensured a comfortable and safe workout environment for all members.

Apart from the excellent facilities and training programs, another aspect that made my experience at Anytime Fitness unforgettable was the sense of community within the gym. I had the opportunity to participate in group fitness classes where I met like-minded individuals who shared the same passion for fitness. The camaraderie and support from fellow members created a positive and inclusive atmosphere that motivated me to push my limits and strive for my fitness goals.

In addition to the exceptional service and facilities, the convenience of having access to the gym 24/7 was a game-changer for me. Whether it was an early morning workout before work or a late-night session to de-stress, knowing that I could hit the gym anytime suited my busy schedule perfectly.

In conclusion, my experience at Anytime Fitness, City Square Mall, has been nothing short of phenomenal. The dedication of the staff, the high-quality facilities, the personalized training, and the sense of community have all played a significant role in not only transforming my fitness journey but also making it an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Anytime Fitness has truly set a benchmark in providing exemplary service, and I am grateful to be a part of such a remarkable fitness community.",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREXzllZXhBRRAB

Anytime Fitness City Square Mall,Haroh Garcia,4,"The gym can get extremely crowded until around 10 pm, especially during peak times when people with tripods make it even worse. It has all the basic machines and equipment that you’d expect from any other AF branch. However, the gym WiFi is barely usable, and my mobile signal drops significantly when I’m inside, rendering my data unusable. I’ve tried using different telcos, but the results are the same. To top it all off, the clock at the free weights area is not accurate, being about a few hours off! It’s been months, and no one has bothered to adjust it.

Edit: they finally fixed the clock and improve the wifi.

There is always a problem with the machines and equipments but these guys rather sit down and wait for members to point it out.Even after I pointed out there was issue with the vending machine .They didnt even bother to put a notice that is not working.The intern just went back to the table to sit in a group and continue chatting .Before this various drinks machine was the power vending machine.Also always not in working condition.To do a comparison with the sister outlet at orchard.Orchard AF is always ready and well maintained .So every time a anytime a member wants to purchase thru the vending machine the the whole cycle pushing starts again Dont bother with this gym.While I admit this gym is clean and spacious.The Malay staffs are there to lepak rather than work.Typical.,a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMmFISDJBRRAB
