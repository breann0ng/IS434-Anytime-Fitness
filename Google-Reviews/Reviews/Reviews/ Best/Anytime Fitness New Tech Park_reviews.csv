Anytime Fitness New Tech Park,Justin Hoyo,4,"GREAT AF outlet and conveniently location near Lorong Chuan MRT! Gym is spacious, has a good variety of equipment, and their changing room area is very nice! Not the cleanest and well-maintained gym, but still acceptable! :)

Visited this gym on the weekends and it was not super crowded (not sure how’s the crowd on the weekdays though). Overall it’s a pretty decent gym with good equipment and spacious setting.. :)",3 months ago,August 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21obGQwNDFVVWhVU0ZOZlR6SXlka2xxTVZGRGIxRRAB

Anytime Fitness New Tech Park,Aida D,1,"Just like recent reviews have mentioned, the state of the gym has changed since the change in management (I think around 3-4 months back or earlier?)

It is now:
- lacking friendly staff
- stale-smelling
- no longer clean
- no longer neat and tidy
- no longer as well maintained

It is quite sad, as I moved to this gym from AF NEX because it used to be clean and had a welcoming feel. The staff back then were so friendly, went the extra mile to ensure the gym ran well and were just sincere about their job.

Unless something is done about it, I am quite sure the state of the gym will continue to deteriorate.",3 months ago,August 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKaE9VcE1hakptUjJSaFFVUTJiRGhsT1U5R1RHYxAB

Anytime Fitness New Tech Park,Deb Ling,5,"Nice, clean, great gym. Easily accessible, near the mrt. Decent equipment, most look relatively new. Chill staff and people. No weird smells (usually). The changing room is bright and clean.

Minor downside is that it gets crowded after 6pm and some of the dumbells are a bit rusty. Showers usually smell a bit funky.

Overall, all things considered, still really good though.",Edited 5 months ago,June 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCOXVXd2hBRRAB

Anytime Fitness New Tech Park,jack,1,"gym is getting from bad to worst. disappointing.

perfect to study in, feels like a library. music is almost non existent.

gym has a sauna.
aircon not even cooling. hotter than the main shopping building. apparently, same central aircon but hot. management don't seem to find the problem as it's been like that for a few weeks already. also, they do not switch on the air con within the gym by the way.
because of that plenty of oil patches from gym users left on the bench.

gym floors and mirrors are filthy.
equipments not maintained. faulty machines not serviced for several months.
benches not maintained. they are just tapped over with duct tape.
water cooler dispenses room temp water.
changing area is smelly.
equipment is not wiped down nor are the floors cleaned.",Edited 4 months ago,July 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMU0JyZmJ2Z2VYeWdnRRAB
Anytime Fitness New Tech Park,T J,1,"An Outrageous Cash Grab

The new management's actions are more than a ""joke""—they're a downright insult. They've shamelessly introduced a predatory policy, charging a $10 fee just to issue a receipt, a basic document that should be provided free of charge. This is a transparent attempt to wring every last cent out of their members, especially those who, like you, have been loyal for years.

After spending at least 2-3K with the club over the last 2 years, you were are with a wall of silence. You were forced to chase them relentlessly—through unanswered calls, ignored emails, and unmonitored WhatsApp chats—just to get a simple reply. And when they finally deigned to respond, they had the audacity to demand a fee for a service that costs them virtually nothing.

The justification for this extortion is as laughable as it is enraging. They claim that since they're not GST-registered, they aren't required to issue a receipt—as if a bank statement is a suitable substitute for a multi-thousand-dollar transaction. They're deliberately creating a bureaucratic nightmare, hiding behind flimsy excuses like ""a lot of administration work,"" when they've already confirmed they have all the transaction details on hand.

This is a new low. They know that many of their members need these receipts for corporate benefits, and they're exploiting that necessity for their own gain. This isn't just about a measly $10; it's about a complete disregard for their members and a cynical ploy to profit off of their own inefficiency. It leaves a bitter taste in your mouth to see a company stoop to such a vile level.",2 months ago,September 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21SMVZVcFZielpIWlVwaFNtbFJlR1ZtZFZvelRVRRAB

It's new, it's clean, it's not packed, it's not huge but rather spacious, and it has pretty much all the equipment I need. 1 Hammer Strength small platform (good for deadlifts/snatches but probably not so much for split jerks), 1 Hammer Strength power rack, 1 Hammer Strength squat rack, 1 Movement First barbell (1 side makes a noise when you spin it, but works fine), 1 unmarked (Ziva?) barbell (it spins so all good), and the highlight for me is the 1 Eleiko WL bar. There are also Hammer Strength coloured bumpers from 5-25kg. No toilets here (only shower and changing rooms), and the lockers are a tad small for larger duffle bags, but other than that, no complaints!",3 years ago,November 2022,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMk1YMmF3EAE
