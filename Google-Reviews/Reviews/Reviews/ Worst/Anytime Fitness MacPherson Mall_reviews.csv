Anytime Fitness MacPherson Mall,Sarah,5,My friend and I signed up at this gym a few months back with their opening offer and we always have a good experience here. During the week we often visit other Anytime outlets due to our hectic schedule but this Macpherson mall outlet is our favourite and we try to visit at least twice a week. Justin and all the staff members are helpful and friendly. This outlet is well-maintained in terms of facilities and cleanliness too.

Anytime Fitness MacPherson Mall,Johnnywoosh,5,"Solid gym. Sign up a breeze with the female gym staff( I assume is Linda?) and we could workout the same day.
(If you have a old dongle, bring it along)

Equipment brand new. Accessories in great condition. A lot of cables to accommodate a big crowd. 2 lat pull downs.

Many squat racks and 2 platforms in a separate unit. Back extension, hack squat, glute, low row plate loaded machines VERY well made. Kudos management for bringing them in, seriously.

Smells good, very clean. Happy to sign here. Please keep it up!

Little suggestion:
Perhaps add a weight horn by the plate loaded machines as it gets hard to access the big plates with 2.5/5s in the way.",a month ago,October 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2twSWFHRm5NVjlXWDI5T0xXTmlSa2QwU1dWbFVHYxAB

Anytime Fitness MacPherson Mall,Chi Hong Hwang,5,"I have been training under Kirtan for about 2 to 3 years. He is great. He has deep knowledge about functional training and helped me through chronic pain in both my shoulders. He still continues to go for more training and certification and works the new knowledge into my weekly training. Now that we've moved to this gym, I'm pleased that he has incorporated heavier weights into my workout. I always enjoy my sessions with Kirtan. He's easy going and easy to talk to. Over the years we've become friends.

They gym is newly renovated so it is clean, well lit and well equipped. There's a good buzz. I was surprised at the many bodybuilder enthusiasts there on a weekday evening but still there was little wait for machines. The gym was located in the basement. A door in the car park opens to the gym entrance after a shot passage. So park at the correct side of the car park.

Anytime Fitness MacPherson Mall,Timon Tai,5,"I've been training with Kirtan for over two years now, and I can honestly say he’s one of the best personal trainers out there. What sets him apart is his deep, holistic understanding of body mechanics. Unlike the typical brute-force, muscle-building approach you get with many trainers, Kirtan focuses on integrating movement, balance, and mobility in a way that makes your body feel stronger and better after every session.

No two workouts are ever the same — I haven’t repeated a single set in all this time. Every lesson is thoughtfully planned, challenging, and fun. And if you ever feel like mixing it up, he also incorporates boxing, which adds another layer of excitement and intensity.

I’ve seen real results, but more importantly, I feel better in my body — more aware, more agile, and more resilient.

Each move was broken down with clear explanations, and Kirtan patiently guided us through every step, making sure we got the form and rhythm right.

What truly stood out was how well-versed and passionate Kirtan is in boxing, his experience shines through in every instruction and correction. Whether you're brand new or just brushing up your skills, you'll learn so much!

We wrapped up with a cool down and stretching session that was not only effective but also really enjoyable, a perfect way to end an intense workout. Overall, it was an fun experience.",4 months ago,July 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwcU0yVkVVMmxLYVVkSWVEVkVXR2xzWXpZMmIyYxAB
