Anytime Fitness Kovan,YC Ang,1,Had a quick workout here while I was in the area for an appointment. It is really as bad as mentioned in recent reviews. Not having new equipment is not a huge issue if well-maintained. Running a gym without proper maintenance is really unacceptable and seems insincere.,9 months ago,February 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfemJtM3dRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kovan,Hana Leong,1,"I can't believe I wasted my hard-earned cash on this dump! The staff is probably the only redeeming factor, but even they can't save this place from being an absolute nightmare. This gym is a disgrace to Singapore! It's like stepping into a horror movie set – broken soap dispensers, rusty equipment, and upholstery that's seen better days. And don't even get me started on the off calibrated machines and blinking lights. The aircon feels like it's blowing warm swamp air, and the whole place reeks of musty desperation. It's such a shame because this gym could have been something great, but instead, it's just a sad, neglected mess. Save your money and your sanity – steer clear of this disaster zone!

I’d rather pay $2.50per entry for activesg at Hougang Stadium",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEa2J6aHBnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kovan,Jacynda Teo,1,"While the AF Kovan branch boasts a larger layout compared to other North East outlets, the narrow rectangular side makes it quite inconvenient. It’s challenging to navigate the space, especially when people carrying weights have to maneuver through—everyone else has to step aside, which can be quite frustrating.

Many of the seats on the machines were torn, and several of the bars were rusty. This level of neglect is concerning and reflects poorly on the overall maintenance of the facility.

What truly horrified me, however, was the condition of the facilities. After using their DIY soap and kitchen towel to clean my hands, I found them covered in rust! It’s incredibly off-putting and raises serious concerns about cleanliness and maintenance.

I hope the management addresses these issues soon, but based on my experience, I can’t recommend this branch at the moment.",a year ago,November 2024,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURINE83ZkJnEAE
Anytime Fitness Kovan,Lirene Bay,2,"One of the worst AF I been around by far. I still got there because I am a fanatic of BodyCombat class and they are the only AF I know about with Sunday class. The airconditioning in the studio were so bad, its like the warmest BodyCombat I been. Fortunately they have a fun instructor, otherwise I don’t think anyone want to be there.
Gym facilities are bad. Need serious maintenance and de rusting. I seen other AF crews did that and don’t understand why this AF can’t. You get your hand all dirty by touching their equipment.",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5NjZxaTBnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kovan,J L,1,"Waited to fairly review this post ‘renovation’.
Aesthetics still as clinical and ugly as ever sadly. Huge gym space but poorly utilised. Dumb bell area could easily fit 4 full racks whilst moving the dumb bell area strategically closer to where the bag area is now. They got the standing tables blocking up space across the whole gym from when the place used to be a bowling lounge or something so they work around the structures from prior leases for an even worse placement of gym equipment.
Almost felt like a renovation was announced and done just to label it one when it made no functional improvements; man even the aesthetic improvements were like a 2/10 to a 2.5/10.
Gym needs a MAJOR makeover from placement of equipment to just about everything else. One of THE WORST gyms available in Singapore, might even be worse than some public gyms. PLEASE, do something about this gym. I’m bouta crash out having this gym as my closest gym. It’s bloody terrible.",5 months ago,June 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VPNnpuSldMeGMzYzJRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kovan,Jiehong Yo,1,"I had a really unpleasant experience with one of your trainers today. He was a skinny guy with long hair and glasses. I had simply taken a Tele bubble, and he immediately assumed I was recording him, which was not the case at all. His reaction was unnecessarily rude and confrontational. I found this behavior completely unacceptable, especially in a gym environment where members should feel comfortable and respected.

Big gym, has tonnes of equipments including functional, boxing, ski erg. They recently just renovated and I love the fresh new look. They have a dedicated studio for group classes like Strong Nation, Circl Mobility, Zumba, Body Combat, Yoga, and Pilates. I've also been doing PT with Khai and he makes sure to make every single session a killer. But the results speak for itself.

The toilets could do with better ventilation but other than that, I'm happy and proud to be a member of Anytime Fitness Kovan.",Edited 2 weeks ago,October 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBc3NEeG9RRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kovan,Geraldine Goh,5,This has to be the biggest Anytime Fitness gym in Singapore. The gym is so spacious and they have a wide variety of equipment and machines. I love that you can take a look at the bowling alleys below the gym when you are taking a break.

Anytime Fitness Kovan,Pringles,1,"Go here if you want...

Rude staff that talks behind your back...
Have broken equipment that takes forever to get replaced...
Machines to be over greased, so your weights fall off and your clothes get dirty and you can't get rid of the grease stains,so you need to throw away your expensive workout clothes...
Broken up floors...
Dirty gym...
Cleaner who will throw the vacuum cleaner cable over your exercise matt, your gym equipment and doesn't care if you can trip over the cable either...
Aircon that doesn't work properly and continuously drips...
If you want to use the equipment for your texting sessions...
Want to get COVID-19...
Don't want 24 hour fitness...
Enjoy trainers who don't care if you do an exercise wrongly, even though you could injure yourself...
Want people to scream and curse in the early mornings and intimate women...while the management can't be bothered to tell that person off but rather chooses to tell the woman to come to different hours to workout...
Go here if you want to be locked out on your last day of contract...even though management and 1 other staff confirmed contract cancelation date...
You want below average gym, gym equipment and staff...then go here and ""be average""!

Anytime Fitness Kovan,Andrew Seah,2,Not sure what is the purpose of having Club Rules when AF staff don't even practice what they preached (Rule 7). They goes around telling ppl to abide the rules but failed to ensure their personal trainees  do so as well. Or is it a case whereby members who signed for their personal training are excused?!

Anytime Fitness Kovan,Ashley Gabasa,1,"The lady club manager loudly insisted that I needed a towel to use the gym, showing a lack of customer service training. She was rude and disrespectful, not even listening to what I had to say, and insisted that I buy a towel. While I understand it's the club's policy, there's a better way to communicate it. This isn't my first time visiting this gym, but if she wants to strictly enforce the rules, she should also ensure that gym-goers are wiping down equipment after use. The rules aren't even applied consistently, as other staff members don't enforce them either. Her behavior made everyone uncomfortable, with some people leaving as a result.

Anytime Fitness Kovan,Daniel “Pringles”,1,"My updated review after 18 months.

Aircon either not working, not working properly or dripping onto you, if you forget and accidentally walk underneath it.

Since about 6 months plated weights started to break down because people are using it to elevate benches. Looks like cookie monster came in and started chewing. Staff knows but people in anytime fitness kovan, can do as they please. Seems that staff doesn't want to approach members because they don't want the conflict.

Lots of people train completely wrong but staff also can't be bothered to correct these people, which eventually will lead to injuries and additionally will also teach unexperienced members, wrong techniques.

Lots of times you go there and it's so crowded that you can't even excercise properly because people just occupy machines and text, rather than workout.

Lots of people don't disinfect the machines after use or use a towel, while staff will just ignore.

Decided not to extend my contract.. Because it has changed from anytime fitness to anytime fitness when it's convenient for me opening hours.

They chat opening hours just because not enough people go at night/early morning.

Much more to write and not enough space..",Edited 3 years ago,November 2022,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDbUx5Y2d3RRAB
