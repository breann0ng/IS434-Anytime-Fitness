Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,Kimi,1,"I visited this outlet with my son in early October for a consultation, and unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. There was a Malay/Indian staff member attending to us, and I was quite taken aback by how rude and dismissive he was when I asked a few basic questions about the membership options.

I was simply trying to understand the pricing and compare it to other gyms in the area, as any parent would do before making a decision. Instead of receiving helpful information, we were met with irritated looks and a tone that made it feel like we were inconveniencing him just by asking. The way he spoke to both me and my son felt unprofessional and disrespectful, as if he was doing us a favour just by having the conversation.

I rarely leave negative reviews, but this experience left a really bad impression. When you walk into a place that promotes health and wellness, you expect a certain level of respect and basic courtesy, especially when you're considering signing up. I hope the management takes this seriously and ensures their staff are better trained in customer service. No one should be made to feel small for asking questions.

If anyone is looking to sign up for a membership I seriously advice you to think twice before signing up at this outlet.",3 weeks ago,October 2025,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t0SmFYUXdPRFl6YW5aVlZVMDNPRlZXYTBKUGRGRRAB

Well ventilated with air conditioning and clean/new equipment. Friendly staff. People here are also more well behaved (lol) and are socially aware. Plus points.

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,Jayvinn Wong,5,"Tldr: The best AF gym in CCK, with lots of well maintained equipment, spacious layout, and clean environment.

My favourite gym in CCK, which is very well taken care of by management and members. The premises are well ventilated and pleasant smelling, without any dust lying around. When I came down in the morning, I saw a cleaner lady meticulously wiping and dusting, kudos to her! Gym members also have the habit of wiping down equipment after use. The aircon was spoilt a few months ago, but it's back now!

The equipment available is quite standard, with 2 full racks, 1 deadlift platform, 1 smith machine, and 1 hack squat machine. They also have the plate loaded low row and incline press machines, which are more unique.

One thing to note is that the toilet facilities and water cooler are outside the gym. This gym also does not have a plate loaded leg press :(

But overall, a superb gym!",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWNl96VG13RRAB

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,H,1,"Had the WORST experience ever with membership renewal. Would not recommend to renew here. Chose to sign up with this outlet to renew my membership. Even after confirming with gym ytd that my membership will begin today, the gym app and wallet pass still showed that my membership was inactive. Apparently it was let slip that the staff - forgot to update my membership. This shows that there’s 0 workflow or handover to make sure that memberships are updated properly. I’ve also been informed now that there are errors to update my profile on the AF website and they are STILL unable to rectify it. Double whammy, just don’t sign up for AF membership here.

AF CCK needs to do a better job at managing memberships.

Update - matter was resolved by Dafina, she was very helpful and patient.

Further Update - Piyo took the time to reach out to me physically at the gym to share about the situation. There was handover from her to another staff about activating my membership, but it seemed that the other staff forgot to activate my gym membership. Appreciate Piyo's sincerity to address this issue directly and also very politely. Great service from Piyo.",Edited 5 months ago,June 2025,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvd3F1TE53EAE

I would like to take this opportunity and share and this is very seriously complaint, faris without any uniform and pass to stop me doing push up on the floor and when I question him in whatapp. He told me he don't need to show me any pass and don't need to wear uniform. He lying and cheating to me yesterday when I visit anytime fitness center his club. He said he are the manager and he stop me doing my bodyweight training on the floor at the machine area near the function area at 10pm. The Floor is so big and square fit and size is so big and he keep talking rubbish to me and back to 6 month ago he never stop me doing push up on the floor at the weight area. He stop me using weight at the weight area that Infront me the person is doing dumbbells chest press. He also knew that I'm the only one came there first before he came. I also request them to check the CCTV who the one came there first. He never apologise to me and never stop the person to stop doing exercise because I'm using the weight and he said afraid the person injured. So you should stop the person. You did not, and continue shouting at me very loud Infront of 20 person. Yesterday I came back after 6 month, he stalking at me and disturb me and talk rubbish because you not satisfied I served you as a seriously complaint.he also disturb me in WhatsApp and said many anytime fitness also have bad review comments. I already check, only you the only one so special bad review comments all complaint and he still Argue with me.

He dare to talk about safety standards and on thursday night 10pm, he drop his dumbbells on the floor center more then 23 minute and talking to a lady at the center function area.

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,Boom Boom,1,"I wouldn’t recommend Anytime Fitness to anyone. Joining is effortless, but leaving? That’s a whole different story. They don’t let you cancel easily—you have to email them after your contract ends, and if anything goes wrong with that email, you’re forced to keep paying. On top of that, they require a 30-day notice, which is just ridiculous. Why make it so difficult for people to leave?

The gym itself isn’t worth the stress. It’s a lot of money per month, yet the service is disappointing. The staff aren’t helpful, and I’ve seen complaints about rude behaviour. A gym should be welcoming, not frustrating.

They said I had to email them after my contract ended, and if they didn’t get the email, I’d have to keep paying. On top of that, I had to give one month’s notice before cancelling.

The gym costs $90++ per month, but the service is terrible. The staff are very unprofessional. The way they talk to customers makes me wonder if they have any proper training at all.

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,黄文忠,1,"Worst gym experience ever. I went to check out the place before signing up, and the staff barely paid attention to me. They seemed uninterested and acted like they were doing me a favour by answering my questions. That should have been my first red flag.

I still decided to join, thinking maybe the facilities would make up for it. Big mistake. The equipment is always occupied, and some machines are either broken or not well-maintained. The worst part? The cancellation process. It’s not straightforward at all. You have to email them after your contract ends, and if anything goes wrong, you’re charged again. Plus, they require one month’s notice. It just feels like they’re making it as difficult as possible to leave.

At almost $100 per month, I expected way better. The staff are unprofessional, the gym is overcrowded, and the whole experience is just frustrating. Definitely not worth it.",9 months ago,February 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcmRUWXNRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,Romee TuTu,1,"While registration is easy, cancelling the membership is a nightmare. They require members to send an email after the expiry date, which is unnecessarily troublesome. If they don’t receive the email (or claim not to), you’re automatically charged for another month—$99, no less! They also have a ridiculous 30-day notice period for cancellations. Why make it so hard for members to leave?

For a gym charging this much, the service should at least be decent. Instead, the staff are unprofessional, as seen in other Google reviews where someone was body-shamed. This is unacceptable. If I wanted to donate money, I’d give it to charity, not to a gym that lacks basic accountability.

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,CY Kang,1,"Experienced an unpleasant moment. One of your staff approached me claiming that I called my friend ""FAT"" at the entrance which indirectly displays to the visitors that the gym has a bad environment that allows the members to address others as FAT. I truly appreciate his professionalism in his work and effort in forbidding body shaming culture in the gym, however, I had explained to the staff that the word coming out of my mouth was ""FEB"" (abbreviation for February) as my friend and I were discussing when were we signed up for the gym, he mentioned it was in MARCH or APRIL and I replied to him ""FEB"" at the entrance. Unfortunately, your staff felt I was being sarcastic and claimed that I was insulting his intelligence. Even though, he said he was not accusing me of anything and just wanted to clarify that the gym doesn't encourage such culture calling others FAT in the gym I had made my stand very clear that I didn't speak any word of FAT and I don't appreciate the way he keep repeating this to me which I had already explained over and over again. Most importantly, the staff is not apologetic at all about his accusations and put a sour face throughout our conversation.

I had paid good money for the use of the club, what I get is this shoddy treatment from your staff.

Further to this, I had emailed on Jan to enquiry on the cancellation after the minimum term. Gotten reply from the assistant manager stated to approach them after my minimum term instead of reminding that there are 30 days of notice period. Luckily this incident happened and I decided to cancel immediately after the min term and it only extend extra two days.

Gym is small with limited equipment, and there are group of customers would hog the equipment for hours, filming video of their lifts and others wouldn't have the chance to share the equipment. There is no control from the staff.

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang Centre,JW Yeo,1,"I was a member between early 2022 to late that year. During that time, I hired a trainer by the name of Ryan Bai. He was late, rude and frequently spent more time on his phone than training people. I fired him after 3 months but already paid more than 3000 SGD in fees.

AF CCK compensated me less than 1000 SGD in membership fees but not the rest because as a third party contractor, he's not considered an AF employee.

Because of work purposes, I had no choice but to keep signing with AF in order to move around freely in Singapore. In the last year, I tried repeatedly to contact AF accounts and marketing to get the additional 2000 back in terms of membership fees.

Now as part of AF woodlands, I get chased every month when there are late fees. I also get annoyed text messages on WhatsApp everytime I'm late for fees. I paid more than 4k SGD in total for 2 years of membership. For all the money I paid, I get this sort of treatment.

I wanted to avoid trouble and simply train my body. But honestly speaking, Gymboxx, ActiveSG and SAFRA have never given me this sort of trouble.
