Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Roger Thomas Tan,5,"This is a rather big gym and I have seen bigger gyms before BUT this gym though just only relatively big is packed with weights and machines! That’s so awesome! They have two Smith machines, three squats machines, one tricep dip machine (how often do you see that?), one chest pull over machine (I didn’t even know they have machines for pull over), TWO free weights area! They absolutely utilised the space fully yet without feeling crampy! They even have a small room for aerobic classes and a few machines for cardio! So even though there are a handful of other patrons around BUT the numerous machines around means you don’t have to share or wait for machines/ weights! This is really a great place to work out! Many machines and free weights to use and it’s just beside the MRT station. Parking can be done in the shopping centre! I’d recommend this place to gym if you are in upper Bukit Timah area!",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6cTRiNnl3RRAB

1 Half rack
1 Deadlift platform
Iso lateral high row (plate loaded)

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Thorvald Kleve,1,"I recently joined this Anytime Fitness branch. Initially, I was quite happy, but they’ve now closed for a month due to renovations — without any prior notification or offer of a refund.

When I raised this with the management, they told me I could have frozen my membership, but since they only posted a notice on social media (which I didn’t see), I missed the chance to do so. They also suggested I use another branch, but I specifically chose this location for its convenience, so that's not a viable option.

In short, while the gym itself is fine, the customer service has been very disappointing.",8 months ago,March 2025,ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRMmFOXxAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Paul Lee,1,"Been a member for roughly 10 years. I wrote in to cancel my membership via email, after being directed from their staff on their WhatsApp chat with instructions to cancel. They acknowledged my membership cancellation and asked me the reason of my cancellation, which is tbh none of their business, and so I didn’t reply. A cancellation email is a cancellation email, I don’t need to explain myself.

The club automatically renewed my membership fee for months until I realised it in my bank statements. They refused to refund the money - I was lucky to have caught it early on, or else they would have charged me indefinitely. Feeling quite dismayed especially being a longtime AFBT gym-goer.",6 months ago,May 2025,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvNlA3Vkd3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Michael,1,"I’ve always appreciated how Anytime Fitness promotes itself as being a part of the community. However, I’m deeply disappointed with the branch at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre. It seems that the business owners here are more focused on profits than truly caring for the community they’re part of.

The poorly waterproofed toilets have caused significant damage to tenants downstairs, with water leaks and even ceilings falling. This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a serious issue affecting the livelihoods of other businesses.

As a brand that prides itself on community, I urge you to take responsibility and fix this problem promptly. Please show that you care for the people and businesses around you, not just your own bottom line.",10 months ago,January 2025,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2dDhIYUR3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Dev Kumar,3,"Definitely has all the fan favorite machines in the house like hack squat, low row  stair master , hyperextension etc but extremely poor wifi reception even when the gym is empty and the machines are very worn out and rusty. Wish they could do a luxurious Refresh because beauty world is meant to represent upper class and also there’s many celebrities and influencers that come here. Very tight space at the dumbbell area as well. Shower facilities are great but there should be one dedicated DRY changing room. There should be more CCTV cameras to cover every area of the gym very clearly cause I know there isn’t one monitoring the charging point which is the most high risk area.",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYb2RERDZnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Jin Kahn Lee,1,"I recently returned to Singapore for a duration and was looking for a fitness solution nearby. As a first time customer, this has to be one of the worst experiences I’ve had dealing with appalling and unprofessional service.

After submitting a query on pricing and membership, I was informed via email that a member of staff would contact me shortly after. I never received the call back, failing which I attempted to contact the number that was provided. After numerous failed attempts and rejected calls, I decided to head down in person to make the inquiry, only to be turned away at the entrance by a staff member who was rude and irritable.

Needless to say, I wouldn’t recommend anyone wasting their time and money on a subpar business that doesn’t seem interested in treating new customers with respect or sincerity.",9 months ago,February 2025,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfN2NyajJBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Sze Chuan Tan,2,"Decent gym in terms of size and availability of equipment.

Reviews about its run-downness is true, I didn't really mind so long things are working properly. I would have given a 4-star but...

I have to knock away 2 stars because of some safety issues. One very big minus point is the wear and tear that can potentially cause injury to users. For example, I tried using a wrist strap to a cable machine and it came off while I was pulling heavy weight. Then I realised the velcro was so worn out that it couldn't be secured properly.

Another minus point is having the power racks with the pull-up bars just directly below the beams of light. Tried to do pull-ups and a beam hit my head because I didn't expect an obstruction in the way.",a year ago,November 2024,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYeWF1dDdRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Shakir Ahmed,1,"I was interested in a monthly membership. The fee was high but was still worth due to 24hr access. However, the registration fee is very high as well as a stupid key fob fee. I couldn't understand at this day and age, why the key fob fee isn't made to be paid as a deposit refundable upon membership termination and returning the key. It's such a stupid business decision.

What am I going to do with the key fob after I end membership? Hang it on my wall as a precious item, sell it or play with it? It's a complete waste of resources and disregard towards sustainability.

There are plenty of gyms around as good as AF or better in terms of equipment but with sensible pricing, so I think they're shooting themselves in the foot.",a year ago,November 2024,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREczdtQlFnEAE

One observation to note is the marked increase in patrons within the past year(nearly 2-3 times) due to new developments in the area. Furthermore, with up and coming condos in the vincinity expected to TOP within the year and next alone adding a further ~1200units in the area, this outlet is going to get really crowded in the near future.

The community is great and the class instructors push me to improve every time. When I first joined, I could barely do a push-up! Now it's much easier than before.

I highly encourage anyone who's looking to get regular exercises to join. These are exercises that I'll never do if I were exercising alone.",a year ago,November 2024,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiaXBmQ0pBEAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Cassie Zhuang,1,"The place and the facilities are very old and worse than activesg gyms and other AF outlets at cc. They enforce a very strict dress code when working out there without clear notices posted in the gym. I was warned by a trainer (he called himself Golden) from the gym who didn’t show clear identification at first, but only told the name aft was asked, and he tried to educate me with common sense and said the requirements abt the dress code was stated in the contract). I can’t believe this is their service standard which is worse than other branches. Actually I feel it doesn’t make sense that they allow people wearing flip flops but only block people wearing cotton shorts. To be honest, the experience there is not even worth one star.",2 years ago,November 2023,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1NXYzSTJnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Timah,Kenny Seong,1,"If I can, I could even not give a star at all. All because of the trainers there. I went to this branch a few time and the last visit I was there, I wanted to ask 1 of the trainer on the ground, Gordon, who was rather free at that point of time on the studio classes schedule and attempted to get his attention by waving and call out to him while was walking towards him, our eyes met yet this Gordon pretended not seeing me and quickly walked away! So I was ignored because he knows I'm a member from another branch and chose to treat me as invisible.

What a customer service you have there, Gordon! Well done! Winning competition is nothing when your nose is so high up in the sky.

2ndly, is the former trainer Wilson (if I remember correctly), short and wear specs. 1 of the most arrogant ego trainer I have ever seen, ask him on certain machine yet he direct me to Gordon and some other regulars there while he himself was just pacing up and down for nothing and as Gordon being himself, walks away and act busy. Lol! What worse was Wilson monopolized the equipment when he and his client was using it! And I was to rush my sets just to let him use as he was standing damn near staring!

Not to mention this 2 clowns even tease their own studio classes' instructors and participants. I walked past them once and they were talking loudly with their friend and mentioned about Zumba class is a joke and ineffective and dont understand why people are still attending it, maybe being stupid.

This branch has the worst trainers I have ever encountered. Not going back to this branch anymore and definitely not recommending to any of my friends.

If you are the owner reading this, probably it's time to educate them or rather, for your gym's sake, sack them.",6 years ago,November 2019,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwaEtESDBnRRAB
