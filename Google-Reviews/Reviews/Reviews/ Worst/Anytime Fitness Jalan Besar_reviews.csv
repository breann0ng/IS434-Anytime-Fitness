Anytime Fitness Jalan Besar,JoJo Lee,5,"Nice and clean gym! The staff are always friendly and welcoming  special thanks to Rayn who helped me sign up for my membership. She’s super helpful and makes the whole experience enjoyable every time I train here. Love the little bread station where you can recharge before or after a workout, such a thoughtful detail! This branch is also less crowded in the afternoons, which makes it extra comfortable to train.

Over time it has gone through many face lifts - new machines, weights and stretching area to keep up with the trend. Its equipment is up to date and sufficient to have a complete workout. While it can be quite crowded during the peak hours, the gym is practically yours the entire time. BONUS points - healthy light snacks are readily available, basic toiletries with clean toilet, and members are allowed to utilise the Body Composition machine. Helps a lot with progress tracking.

The standout feature for me is the incredibly friendly staff, who consistently greet every member with a warm smile.

Anytime Fitness Jalan Besar,Gannon Waye,1,As staff of this brand I am disgusted at the price they charge for casual pass! This gym is tiny and offers extremely limited options to workout and yet they charge $170 Singapore dollars for 7days to non members / tourists! Never have I been more disappointed in a business and ripping off people. At least be a decent enough establishment. Don’t waste ur time. ACTIVE SG just around the corner is $3 per visit :) much better,10 months ago,January 2025,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2eGZXUFpREAE
Anytime Fitness Jalan Besar,Emily Shoup,3,This gym is not for vacationers! A day pass is 33 Singapore dollars (that is more expensive than any gym I’ve ever used in the states or Europe) and non-members can only work out from 12-8. Not ideal times when you have limited time to spend. The space was also tiny which would have been fine if it hadn’t been so expensive.

But I cannot say the same for some of the un-hygienic gym members here. I often find pee stains, pees on the toilet seats. Equipments (dumb bells and bar bells especially) left on the floor and didn't re-rack after their workout

Some gym members who are sick and wish to work out, cough loudly & openly while working out, spreading germs to other gym members who are there to work out. Very ""considerate"" huh?

The gym coaches are friendly too!

Just remember to bring your access pass for entry. If not, you're not allow to enter & any member open the door for you will liable a $30 fine for them.

If you have a friend who is a gym member here, ask them to bring you here. So that both of you can work out together!",6 years ago,November 2019,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvMzVQVDZnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Jalan Besar,Mister CH,3,"It's Anytime fitness.
I've been to other centers before, and this gym was pretty standard. The only reason I'm giving this one 3 stars out of 5 is because i witnessed a few things that kinda disturbed me.

There was a gentleman here doing his leg raises on the bench, and apparently he decided it'd be a good idea to pick a dumbell with his barefeet to add some more intensity to his workout.
I saw that over and over, day after another..  and ewwwww... No offense or disrespect is intended but c'mon bruh.. that's not what dumbells are for.
