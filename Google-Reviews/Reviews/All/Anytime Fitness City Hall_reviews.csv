Anytime Fitness City Hall,Jack Liaw,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Outstanding honesty and care from the staff!
I recently misplaced my iPad Pro at Anytime Fitness City Hall and thought it was gone for good. To my surprise, the staff kept it safe and returned it to me when I came back. Their honesty, professionalism, and genuine care for members truly deserve recognition. It’s rare to find such trustworthy people these days.
Thank you to the whole team for going above and beyond — you’ve earned my full respect and gratitude. Highly recommended gym with amazing people! 💪✨
Thanks every AF cutyhall staff.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25wb2RYcDJVekZQY1ZSdmJWUnhVME4wWVRaSmFFRRAB

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Deckerz,4,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
A well-equipped and welcoming fitness space.

I've been really impressed with this Anytime Fitness location. The gym is well-maintained and offers a complete range of equipment to support any workout style. There's a full set of dumbbells, multiple pull-focused machines (I counted at least four), and a great selection of cardio machines that are almost always available—no waiting around even during peak hours.

Whether you're into strength training, cardio, or functional fitness, you'll find what you need here. The atmosphere is clean, organized, and conducive to a focused workout. Definitely one of the better Anytime Fitness branches I've visited.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25aaU9YUlZZMUZ5VVdZMmJGUmpkSE5tZFhaWUxWRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,Jerald Chong,5,"Extremely pleasant and satisfactory experience each and every visit with welcoming and friendly staff, clean and efficient equipment which are often well maintained in terms of usability and cleanliness.

Safety is always prioritised and strongly enforced to keep the welfare of the members in mind.

Really spacious gym, even during peak hours, where I am not required to necessarily wait long for equipment or share with that many people. Many mirrors and satisfactory lighting for those who are into taking aesthetic pics/vids.

Convenient location within citylink mall, with many nearby eateries and shopping options.

Definitely my go to gym of choice whenever I’m around town or done with work.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25CcFJrSnJlakpWUm5CWGVUTllNR1YxVFZZeldGRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,PZ C,5,"I don't really know how to use gym equipment so all 5 stars in this review are primarily for Seed who teaches the Zumba class on Fridays at 7pm. His energy and exuberance is infectious, he brings an impressive array of dance and musical genres into the choreography and the class is welcoming to people of all levels, whether you're a regular with some dance background or a total newbie just looking to soak in the good vibes. I don't really have a preference for AF outlets since the machines are the same everywhere but it's the instructors who make all the difference. Thank you Seed for giving your all every class!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tWd09VMU1RV3ByVGtsNFdIUkVSbkZMTFVGaE9IYxAB

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Adam Mcilroy,5,Af cityhall is one of the best gyms to use in singapore for strength training and bodybuilding. Staff are always friendly and ready to help.

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Sihan Goi,3,"Update: Was just there earlier today for a morning workout. I was doing some clean and jerks, and it got a bit heavy so I dropped the bar from overhead. Note that this branch has bumper plates, spin bars, and platforms, i.e. equipment that are well suited for weightlifting. However, right before my last set, a gym staff came over and told me in a displeased manner ""Sir, this is not a powerlifting gym"", and told me that dumping the bar from overhead was not allowed. While I can understand gym rules (and I complied with it in my final set), the way and manner in which he brought it to my attention was no ideal. Also, there's quite a lot of unpack in his statement. First, I wasn't ""powerlifting"", I was ""weightlifting. A gym staff who doesn't know the difference between the 2 sports doesn't instill a lot of confidence. Secondly, this gym has Eleiko powerlifting competition bars, so if it isn't a ""powerlifting gym"", i.e. it disallows powerlifting, I wonder why they bothered getting powerlifting equipment?

Minus 2 stars for the bad experience.

This is apparently the biggest AF in Singapore, and while it's big, it wasn't as huge as I expected, and isn't substantially bigger than, say, AF Pasir Panjang. Equipment wise, it's definitely well stocked. There's a warmup area with all kinds of warmup equipment (foam rollers, smfr balls, bands of various thicknesses, plyo boxes, light dumbbells, kettlebells, etc). I didn't take note of the machines too much, but the free weights area is also quite well equipped, with 3 half racks with attached platforms, another 3 full packs, Ziva hybrid bars and bumper plates, and a couple of Eleiko Pl bars. The platforms and bumper plates aren't the usual bouncy Hammer Strength ones, and don't look as new as the gym (maybe used elsewhere before?) but they also don't bounce as much, which helps with the noise. I also didn't see any specific warning against dumping the weights, so that's nice. Crowd wise, it was quite manageable on a Wednesday lunch time around 1 to 3pm. Was able to get the half rack and platform to myself. Shower facilities are also one of the better ones compared to other AF. Overall, a good place to train if in the area.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkcExPRU1REAE

Anytime Fitness City Hall,LX Koh,5,"Been training with Leonard and he has been a great trainer and mentor. He’s a good listener and motivator. My life has changed for the better.

The equipment is well maintained and there is a huge selection. I’m not disappointed. The location is convenient and I have to admit I’m spoiled by the range of equipment. I can’t see myself going anywhere else.

Small note: please ensure there is enough moisturiser and deodorant in the female toilet, as they run out often.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWV1pqWjVWbU5wYjJNMFYwOTFhMFowWWxWb1JIYxAB

Super spacious and well organized layout. Lighting is well planned too, which adds to the aesthetics and something out of the ordinary AF gym interiors you might find elsewhere.

I came on a Sunday early afternoon, so the crowd wasn't that bad. I'm sure weekdays after working hours might be worse.

Awesome gym. Will be back for sure!

Secondly, been member about 3 months, during lunch all Treadmill was fully occupied, have to wait about 20-30min, It is wasting time to rush down and waste money for keep paying member fee. As due to my health condition, for myself only can work on Treadmill, so i join AF@City Hall & also recommended by my CFO who is also member of AF.

But the adductor and abductor machines have been out of order for over a month now, and it looks like another leg machine’s joined the holiday. Maybe they’re just waiting to complete the “leg day outage” collection before fixing them all at once.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tsdGMyaERlbVJtV0c5NVh5MXFkMk53TmxoMFNsRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,jonathan low,5,"There are many Anytime Fitness gyms in Singapore, but having a great one in such a central location at City Hall is a real plus. The gym is spacious, clean, and well-maintained with a good range of equipment for both strength and cardio. The atmosphere is welcoming, and members are generally polite and considerate. The staff and trainers do an excellent job of keeping the environment positive, so both regulars and first-timers feel comfortable training here.

I personally train with Affandy, and the experience has been fantastic. He not only pushes me to improve physically, but also takes the time to check on overall wellbeing—things like nutrition, recovery, and stress management. Having a trainer who genuinely cares makes a big difference, and it keeps me motivated to stay consistent.

5 stars for Anytime Fitness City Hall, and definitely 5 stars for Affandy!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT201MU1VVnFhM0JFUnpGTU1uQjNXVEJhVFV3NU5GRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,Jeremy Chan,5,"This is the 1st time I’ve been this gym & just entering it blew my mind away! This gym can compete with the Chai Chee branch IMO. Albeit the Chai Chee one has a few less common equipment, this gym definitely has more than the other Anytime Fitness(apart from Chai Chee, they are on par) gyms in Singapore.

The equipment, machines, free weights etc. are all pretty much brand new & in pristine condition. If I had to decide whether this or the Chai Chee branch were my favorite AF gyms in Singapore I would be extremely hard pressed to choose. The are both @ the top for me. Top 3 AF gyms in Singapore are City Hall, Chai Chee, & then Geylang Central. In order expect for the top 2 where I am unable to decide, lol.

*Update* : After being to both this City Hall & Chai Chee AFs a few more times again. I’d like to mention that IMO, City Hall is now the clear winner & would be @ the top of my list of best AF gyms in SG. You have designated toilets/showers for both genders, & a staff consisting of some veteran trainers. Apparently the gym gets crazy packed during peak hours though, so y’all might wanna watch out for that. I go usually during early to mid afternoons & there are more people than other AF gyms even during those hours. Hope all these info helps!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkczRId2FREAE

Biggest AF in SG - possibly. Most generous equipments - possibly. 3 to 4 deadlift stations and racks. Include a wheel to flip too. Loads of cardio machines (but why?). Got a spacious studio for classes. Stretching/TRX corner tad small for big gym.

Crowd is lively - mainly youngsters from nearby uni or schools. Alot there to socialize.

Good if you're there to social but may not be great to train as groupies hang out here.

Restroom and shower a little messy and not that clean compared to other AFs IMO.

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Candice Judith,1,"Been an AF member for nearly two years, was at a different gym prior and am currently working in the fitness industry. I recently started going to the City Hall gym more regularly.

At peak hours this specific trainer would hog 3 machines/stations for a client and making it inaccessible/inconvenient for other members, and when others would enter the unused stations we would be disallowed even if they weren’t in active use:

1.) laying out the mat in high traffic areas or in front of/next to machines disrupting access, 2) tying resistance bands on machines and not allowing others to use said machine.

My partner has once asked this trainer if he could use a machine (since there was no one on it) to which he begrudgingly said he was using. Again, there was no one on it.

A recent visit on 9/20 (1.20pm) left a bitter feeling after my interaction with this trainer. He was at the purple mat area with the battle ropes laid out, half-bosu and foam roller. I asked if he was still using the bosu ball (at this point he’s coaching his client how to use the battle ropes), and while he handed the half-bosu to my direction he dropped it on the ground before I got a grip on it. It felt like this was a deliberate move because I had entered his space.

The gym is supposed to be a welcoming space for all bodies and individuals. As an AF trainer representing the brand, this is not the kind of environment that I associate with the Anytime Fitness brand.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pCb1JYbG9ZMWd4WWxsRVdHdDBXREJwWW05ZmJXYxAB

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Hello Ang,1,"Your policy states:

“When you are a part of the Anytime Fitness family, you can work out at gyms nationwide AND around the globe thanks to our worldwide club access. Think of it as a global membership plan.”

But your staff denied me access when I was on vacation in Singapore over the long weekend and tried to access the gym with my keyfob. Your staff said that international keyfob is not accepted at this branch — which is against your own policy?

Ps. I was in Malaysia and Japan earlier this year and the access worked just fine.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2kxMlgyVkZaV0l6T0hScE9VUjVSRm96VjNOaFpFRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,Katherine,5,"I gave 5 stars as I enjoy training at City Link until my recent’s training when a member refused to share the smith machine.  A lady was using a bench doing her exercises and left the smith machine unused most of the time.  Initially I informed her that I would trained after her but she was unhappy and told me to use other machines as she would be long.  I then used the leg press next to the smith machine.  Seeing that she didn’t use the smith machine most of the time and after I completed my exercise I asked her whether I could share the smith machine.  She refused to share and asked me to use other machines again.  I told her that I could use the smith machine when she finished her set but she just simply very stubborn and refused to share.  She asked who am I to tell her and asked me to get the Manager to talk to her.  With this kind  attitude and whereever she goes she will not be willing to share.

I then approached the staff for help.  Despite staff’s intervention she still refused to listen. The lady then told the staff that the more I talked the longer I had to wait to use the machine.

What is the purpose of printing wordings on the wall asking members please share the machines?

How can we allow member be so selfish?

What actions will the owner take against the member?

Thank you",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VPdURqX2IwX3FiQ1BBEAE

- Equipments are well maintained
- It's spacious and in the mornings the gym is pretty empty which is nice

However one area of improvement, not a fan that the evolut body scanning is inside the staff room.

I understand that there needs to be staff supervision, but I've had instances where the staff outright refused to let me use, even while they're in the room. Not all staff, there's one in particular that doesn't bother.

It's also an issue when there's no staff available, so it's hard to keep track when I need to scan.

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Spartan Dan,4,"There's a reason why they call this the biggest AF in SG. Literally loads of squat rack, deadlift platform, machines and weights. Workout wise you are literally spoiled for choices. Would have given a 5 star if it's not for an unpleasant experience with a staff.

Usually the lat pulldown machine there will be an extra weight to stack like either 5 or 10lbs if for etc
U want 170lbs, but the stack weights is from 160lbs then next 180lbs
So there's no option for that I decided to take a 10pound weight plate to stack with the pin.

I know it's not the usual right thing but other AF I did it's okay so I didn't know for this one. A staff pass by a just tell me
""Hey cannot do this ah. Take out take out!"" And walk away

I said I'm sorry he just turn behind and gave me an unpleasant look.

It does give me a bad feeling for a while but I just finish through my workout.

So doesn't mean the biggest AF in SG comes with the best experience ah.

Given the opportunity maybe I'll come but town area. I hate the town crowd and stuck up people. So I'll stick to the heartland AFs.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYbVpybzRBRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,Haqqul Azmi,5,"This gym is at a very convenient place and easy to find. My jaw seriously dropped when I saw how massive this place was. Nice atmosphere with a very wide variety of equipment. Was reading the other reviews and I personally don't see the problem with a place being too ""ameteurish"" (if that even is a thing). Everyone there had a friendly vibe and was working on themselves.
Definitely one of the best af's in Singapore. Will be coming here again 😁😁",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwd2J2dW13RRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,Nigel Lim,5,"Not my home gym.

But the space here is huge with a myriad of machines and equipment to cover your every need.

Staff was very nice and sincere to offer a helping hand as well.

11/10 will recommend for the vibes and tools.

not sure about the pricing now - so the recommendation does not cover this.

--

Oh! But if the toilets can be kept dry for people to change out - it will be great! (i.e. for those that prefers to use the cubicles - the toilet bowl cubicle is somehow perpetually wet) - just a small thing.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsX3FuQU1BEAE
Anytime Fitness City Hall,JW Yeo,3,"I think I have to be a bit objective here:

1. I love this outlet because of the size, extensive collection of work out fixtures, machines and other equipment.
2. The staff are very helpful and friendly .
3. But having been to many AFs around the island, the powerlifter hogging, entitled children tiptokking, and gossipy atmosphere persists.
4. I know physique, muscle mass, and looking svelte is more important than ever in the Social Media age. But being rude and obnoxious is not ""Alpha."" Most of these children wouldn't be able to afford any of the membership fees or the 300.dollar designer sneakers without parental assistance. I don't think working professionals should pay to feel as if they're second-rate customers because a posse of rich kids like to show off their ""muscled"" after one rep.
5. I really like coming to this branch because of the size and urban location. But honestly, I am just entirely giving up on Anytime Fitness. This is beyond childish. The staff do their best, but the company's management let's them down. And it's let the customers down as well.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbzVLNVdREAE

Anytime Fitness City Hall,The InvisibleGaijin,4,"Fantastic gym experience in Singapore. Mostly positive experience with some room for improvement. Very spacious with a huuuge variety of machines that offer full body workout if you prefer a safe and more stable workout compared to free weights. The weights available also go beyond what other AF outlets offer. Side note: I don't think having ""amateurish"" gym goers should affect anyone's gym experience. Everyone has a  different starting point.

I really love the variety of machines that work the back muscles, but did wish there was a lateral raise machine for shoulders.
The air con isn't as powerful as I'd like and the toilet sinks did not have soap loaded. Also wished there was wet wipe dispenser instead of the dry paper towel and spray option. Overall still an outlet I would recommend for a solid workout pump.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNweWFuS2NREAE

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Dev Bhatt,5,"Disclaimer: These opinions are purely my own. I'm just your regular gym enthusiast. Although my usual spot is a different Anytime Fitness outlet owned by the same incredible owner, I've experienced his dedication, passion for the industry and eye for detail first-hand.

Stepping into the Anytime Fitness at City Hall is like taking a breath of fresh air. It's not just a gym – it's an experience. The ambiance here is unparalleled, inviting and full of energetic vibes that push you to achieve that extra rep or mile.

When it comes to equipment, let's just say it's evident that quality wasn't compromised. Each machine feels like it's top-notch, catering to every muscle group you want to work on. No more waiting for that one popular machine; they've got you covered!

But, it's not just the machines that make a gym. The heart of this place lies with its staff. I have seldom come across such a friendly and accommodating team, always eager to assist and make your gym experience worth every drop of sweat.

Price? Competitive doesn't even begin to cover it. To all those who're shelling out big bucks at other ""big brand"" gyms, I have just one thing to say: Do yourself a favour and check out Anytime Fitness City Hall. Your wallet and your muscles will thank you.

Lastly, a massive shoutout to the entire team of Anytime Fitness City Hall - you guys are the real MVPs, making every gym-goer's journey smoother and more enjoyable. Wishing you all the success (and gains) in the world!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwa3M3RlhREAE

What's even better is that they offer classes not just in the evening but also during the noon hours, making it super convenient for people with slightly different working schedules and freelancers like myself.
I just wish I lived a bit closer to the area to fully take advantage of it. There's one class that makes the one-hour MRT ride to City Hall absolutely worth it – Monday's noon MetCon with Hirda. She brings fantastic energy and motivation to the sessions, the class is challenging in all the right ways and will surely push you to your limits.

Anytime Fitness City Hall,Jesse Adam,1,"One of the worst Anytime Fitness in Singapore. The only thing it has going is its size. The male toilet is dominated with people posing without a care in the world of others needing to use the toilet, and the very obvious injections going on in there. No one, absolutely no one, reracks or cleans the equipment after use. It is almost impossible to use any machine without some kid chasing you away from a mile away saying ""I'm reserving this machine"". Kids hogging the machines and benches by sitting there using their phone, picking a fight with you when you ask to share or simply asking ""how many sets do you have left?"". The very very obvious bias to attract influencers who come and go where the money takes them without a care in the world for regular, proper, well-mannered gym-goers. The lack of proper reinforcement of good gym etiquette such as reracking and cleaning the equipment after use like how Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar does.

All in all, 0 star. Will never recommend anyone who genuinely wants a place to work out to come here unless the pain they enjoy is mental pain and/or just trying to look for a fight with the kids who go there.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsaGNIQzZBRRAB
Anytime Fitness City Hall,Jet Lin,5,"I don't normally review AF gyms but this gym is the or among the best AF in Singapore. Big, spacious, many barbell stations to use. And one more thing that I wouldn't thought will be a plus factor is the MUSIC. It's the only gym where I don't bring my own headphones as the music is fire. It's EDM remix of popular songs from a wide range of artists, when I was there today I heard remix of ratm/queen/ACDC/MCR/nirvana/snoop dog/ dr Dre among many others.

- Big, spacious and clean.
- Friendly staff.
- Interesting and uncommon equipment such as the tyre-flipping machine and the booty builder.
- If you are into classes, its class area is the biggest I have seen for an AF.

Cons:
- Does not allow use of regular plates at deadlift area - only bumper plates allowed, even if the first plate is a bumper plate such that the regular plates don't touch the ground.
- The smallest regular plate is 5kg. Combined with the preceding point, this means one would only be able to add weights at 10kg intervals for deadlifts, because you can't use the 1.25kg and 2.5kg regular plates.
- No chalk (whether regular or liquid) allowed.
