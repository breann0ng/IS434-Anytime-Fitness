Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Muhammad Jazly,5,"I’ve been training at Anytime Fitness Parkway for several years now and I can confidently say it’s one of the most well-run and welcoming gyms around. The staff have always been friendly, professional and respectful. They’re attentive when needed but never intrusive, and they genuinely care about maintaining a good experience for everyone.

The gym is spotless, equipment is well maintained, and everything feels organised and safe to use. It’s clear that the team takes pride in keeping the space clean and orderly, which really adds to the overall experience.

I’ve come across some of the recent negative comments about staff attitude, but honestly, they don’t reflect what I’ve consistently experienced here. The staff simply ensures that everyone follows basic gym etiquette such as re-racking weights and keeping equipment in its proper place. These are standard practices in any professional gym, meant to keep the environment safe and enjoyable for all members. I also appreciate that the team maintains this standard consistently, as it means I don’t have to deal with the occasional negligence or self-entitled behaviour of others who leave their weights behind.

What I’ve always appreciated about Parkway is the balanced atmosphere. It is structured enough to promote discipline, yet still friendly and approachable. It’s the kind of place where regulars respect one another and new members are easily welcomed in.

This branch truly reflects what a well-run gym should be, a clean, encouraging, and built around a respectful community.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xkYWJ5MXRNMmxXWW5oc1FXeFVTVGxRTUhKYVRtYxAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,David Ethan,5,"Based on my experience with Anytime Fitness Marine Parade, this is by far the best gym within the area. From its location to the overall cleanliness and organization of its equipment and the welcoming and friendly vibes that the staff displays on a daily basis, I have always enjoyed myself whenever I stepped foot into the facility.

I have seen some people's criticism of this gym, especially when it comes to the issue of re-racking weights. I think it is unfair to label the staff's demeanor because at the end of the day, they are just doing their job. As members, I think we need to be better because we should create a more pleasant experience for other users in the gym.

This isn't about taking offense to what the staff tells you to do. This is all about displaying good gym etiquette. It's not difficult to re-rack your weights accordingly or return equipment to the right places, especially when we are adults. We should always remember that we do not own the gym. Like other members, we pay money to utilize a private facility and if we cannot adhere to a basic rule like returning your equipment, I don't think y'all should be using a shared space.

We need to stop with this entitlement. As long as we create a pleasant experience within the facility, everyone will go home with positive emotions and not resort to complaining like kids. Let's do better for the betterment of the employees of the gym and other members who use their hard earned money to pay for a gym membership.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tkR1RGZDRjRjluZURoTWRITmFXVFZRZG1oMWFVRRAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Czar Bordador,5,"It is a joy to come to AF Marine Parade everyday. Being able to work out in a friendly and vibrant environment not only motivates me, but also allows me to easily make friends with fellow gym goers.

The wide range of equipments give me an exceptional workout experience. The Staff are not just super friendly, they are very informative and really take time to help you.

Overall for me this is the best gym and nothing to improve. Keep it up!💪🏼",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s5U1NHSXpTM0pxU0Zsc1dUSTVTME5sVEZvMlZGRRAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Hi Hi,1,"AF Marine Parade was my home club for 7 years. I used to love the friendliness and warmth of the staff and gym environment.

Recently, whenever I gym here, the staff will give unfriendly stares, every single time.

And then they will approach you in an unfriendly way, like a school teacher talking down to a student, to ensure each weight is racked according to the correct weight

While I always rack my weights back every single time, I sometimes genuinely make a mistake and do not rack it on the correct level

That’s when you can see the PTs eyeing you and then they will come and talk to you like a student who must be punished 😬

Eventually the environment just didn’t feel conducive nor friendly and safe and my membership got automatically moved to another AF nearby, where I feel the staff are much friendlier and the atmosphere is lighter and not intense at all like AF MP",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25BelgxRlpZbTFtTURkQ05rRnpSR2Q1Ukd4MWJYYxAB

Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,David,5,"Convenient location with good variety of fitness stations/free weights, familiar faces & lively music.

Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Masteryoga0425,2,"I love the environment, it's clean and neat but the staffs can be rather unfriendly. It is courteous to greet someone before correcting their form or asking them to return equipment, and important to keep the tone friendly rather than condescending.

For work, I have visited many AF outlets across Singapore, and this is the only one I have had an unpleasant experience with. I hope the staff can show a little more courtesy and warmth when approaching gym-goers.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwQ1RqVnRjRzlQWTJNdGIxcFlPVEprVVZwdVJWRRAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Wei Quan,1,"Fully agree with the last reviewer.

The staff at the office are great. Gym is clean and great facilities

But the personal trainers look really unfriendly and speak to members in a really condescending way to rack the weights correctly

Members would definitely be happy to but don’t talk down to people and don’t interrupt people halfway through their sets just to make yourself look more high and mighty

The gym is great, the office staff are great, but the PTs really need to lose that arrogance",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s4MWJXODFhV1l5UXkxaVpERk5kRTR4VVhwc2FHYxAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Yu Wei Bian,5,"Joined the gym at the start of the year to rehab my knee. Training with Nasz has been transformational- his corrections are spot on and based on deep knowledge and experience. Training is also good fun, making it easy to commit to even late at night on a weekday. I can honestly say that my knee has been 95% back to normal, and I can run again without pain. Also, I genuinely appreciate their high standards of safety, and commitment to maintaining a safe, inclusive, and non-intimidating space for a variety of gym users.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s5YVp6UjRSWHBMVWpsVlVXOHlVbFZ0TURKNGFHYxAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,tricia phua,1,"second time visiting this gym and wasn’t pleasant. staff are unfriendly and condescending. saw many other reviews about the staff being unfriendly as well, from many months ago and somehow they are still acting the same way?

was doing the leg press machine and apparently there’s different weights to be used for different machines. one staff asked me mid workout why i was using another type of weight for the leg press. context: my boyfriend used it before me so he took the hack squat weights and placed it on the leg press as he was using the hack squat before.

i was very lost with his question cause why does it matter..? staff said the weights on the leg press was easier to be used since its on the machine alr and asked where i got the other weights.
i said i dont know cause my bf was the one who used it before me. he proceeded to jst smile and walk away.

no point stated, just weird questions. and as someone who has been here twice idk what weight is meant for what.

after i was done with the machine i placed 2 20kg weight back on the hack squat but on the 15kg side and 2 other 20kg on the floor leaning towards the leg press machine.

same staff came up to me instantly and said “usually our SOP is 20kg below and 15kg on top of the hack squat. and this weights dont belong on the leg press thats why i asked you just now why you using another type of weight for the leg press. and since your boyfriend was the one who took it, u better ask him to put it back where it came from.”

staff sounded demanding and veryy condescending. could have sounded more approachable and helpful. also could have made this point when he first asked me why i was using a different weight for the leg press. dk why he waited till i finish to make his point.

afterwards, the staffs also stare at me like i was a foreign creature in their gym just cause idk their “SOP”

never experienced this before in any other gyms in sg.

so, not a good experience and definitely not coming back.
with the amount of same reviews about the staffs being unfriendly, condescending and similar experiences from months ago and up till now, seems like the gym isnt doing anything to improve their staffs attitude 🫤",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25OUFpqQmtNbmRQU1ZoRVZtTm9kMFJVYW5NNVVIYxAB
Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Jeremy Lim,5,Have been to a lot of AF outlets. Think this may be top 3 if not the best. 3 squat racks; the right machines but still feels like an open space.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYbV9PY0ZnEAE

Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,john sofjan,1,"Just had a leg day at this outlet. While on the leg extension machine, was asked to arrange the weight plates according to weight, not just return the weight pegs on the smith machine as the weights were cleared up.

I hope they chase every user this way because it’s clearly not working, as I’ve had to pack weights for the user before me. On every plate loaded machine. Every single time.

Looks like they pick and choose when to chase people. Like when it’s off-peak and it’s easier to look like they are doing their job. Take a picture before using the equipment.

Feel free to reach out to me, since you look up posters. My name is up there.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMYnIyOUduMU1XT21BRRAB

however, hardly anyone follows the guidance to bring their own towels and clean the equipment after use which is not enforced by the staff.

Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,maryanne,1,"tldr: staff are rude & unfriendly, just come off-peak when they’re not around

just giving a heads up to all who come here. i am an anytime fitness member AT marine parade.

likewise with the bad reviews 2 years ago, the staff/PTs here tend to disturb people on their working sets. i believe his name is joshua, but most of the staff here give unfriendly looks if you’re new to the gym (even when i first signed up).

i’ve seen them constantly howl at gym go-ers to put clips on and/or, re-rack weights correctly WHILE the people are still on their workouts. (even if they’re on warm up sets or going to use the weights taken and placed on another holder)

this has occurred on multiple occasions, not only to me but i’ve seen in happen to others too. the staff are not mindful and pretty arrogant in the way they address people who come to this gym. they have also purposely ignored my feedback on IG.

hopefully you won’t experience this too, they might just quote that they’re a family/elderly friendly gym. lol

EDIT (23/10): i’m experienced and have also used a burner account as i see that this AF has the tendency to track down their records to blacklist or make sure to know who’s writing this. 😂",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNucmFuZGxBRRAB

I’ve been to a few different AF outlets before but MP is still the best I reckon. Management and staff ensures the place is always super clean, with sufficient tissues and sanitizers for you to wipe down equipment after you’re done.

Anytime Fitness Marine Parade Central,Samz Said,5,"My wife and I have been members since June 2014. Without any hesitation, we left another fitnees centre to join Anytime Fitness Marine Parade because it is nearer to our home, has ample parking spaces and most of all, it is opened 24/7.

Jason and Cara always make us feel welcomed when they call us by our names to say ""Hi"" each time we enter the gym. Naz is also a very friendly and knowledgeable trainer/admin assistant as he interacted with us during our registration to be members. Once we were members, he never hesitated sharing workout advice while we are working out even though we did not engage him as our personal trainer.

The most impressive thing about this gym is of course, all the equipment available. The space is big and we can use the free weights without worrying that we may hit another equipment or person.
