Anytime Fitness Dakota,Xen Ng,5,"Affan was super nice, detailed, and extremely patient! As a beginner at the gym, he walked me through everything I needed to know — even the sign-up process. I was kinda drilling him with questions due to some misunderstanding, but he handled it so well.

At the end of the day, I walked out not just more knowledgeable, but officially a member of Anytime Fitness starting 25 Oct!! 💪🔥

I’m really looking forward to improving my health and physique. I’ll definitely keep y’all posted — if I look better than yesterday… and one month from now, you’ll know! 😆✨",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25kaVVtZGZWemhXU1RobE1tNXBZbTFIVURGSkxYYxAB
