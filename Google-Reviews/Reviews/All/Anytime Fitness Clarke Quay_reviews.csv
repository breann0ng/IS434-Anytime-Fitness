Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Ian,4,"The most aesthetic AF outlet in Singapore!
Super convenient location right at the heart of Clarke Quay.

As others mentioned, the outlet isn’t that big, but it’s still a great place to get a solid workout. Some equipment is missing, but it gets the job done.

Love how the gym is designed — it gives off such a relaxing vibe. The natural light during the day gives me that extra boost to move!

The staff are really friendly and always ready to greet you.

The shower rooms and toilets are clean and well-maintained too. Just a small note — the floor in the changing area tends to be wet, so be careful.

I was looking for an ab roller/wheel but couldn’t find one, so I hope they can add it soon.

Definitely a must-try outlet, especially on weekends! If you’re after a relaxing and cozy vibe, check this one out.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pRM2RtMVdhbVZaUjNOWE4xb3hlV05xTVRKa2RuYxAB
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Justin Hoyo,4,"Great gym! Came here for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. The gym is not huge per se, but it was well-equipped and well-maintained. It’s an interesting loft concept, with the functional area on the upper level.  They have separate male and female proper toilets/locker rooms as well.

The only downside is that the weight area is quite cramped and only 1 cable station. So if it gets crowded, it may be difficult to get a good workout in. But for non-peak hours, the gym is perfect :)",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pOWVZrcEVaVGRYUldSMk16SnpSakp2Tm1sSVlYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,In2rovert Life,5,"Visited tons of AF Worldwide and this is one of the nicest gyms in one the best locations (Clarke Quay) in an old shop house/warehouse/club on the 2nd floor.

Good amount of equipment and even a dual sided power squat rack

(allows 2 people to squat on both ends at the same time).
The usual weight selection and plated strength machines, treadmills & machines for cardio.
Only thing missing is a lateral raise machine and I would stay in this gym forever.

They even have a small floor area above overlooking the gym with a rope workout, a crossfit rope machine, or for you to do any workout on the usual comfy purple AF mats.

Large area with rafters, plenty of showers (men's had 2 toilet stalls).

After you're done. NTUC Finest is nearby to grab something, and CQ/Fort Canning MRT are nearby.

Or if you want to end your workout with cardio, Fort Canning Park is just across the Street.

Prime location and one of my favourite AFs in Singapore.
Ps: (their gym soundtrack reminded me of my clubbing days)",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pWc2EwZHNhWEJpYkRsa01WRnJTME10TFRKYWFVRRAB
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Lim,5,"New equipment, fresh, but can get crowded on weekday evenings. Smaller in real life than how it looks on the social media photos 😅 once you enter the door, you have to climb a flight of stairs up to floor 2 for the main workout area. Due to space limitations, not a lot of racks. Nice to have a “private” quiet space on the upper floor. But overall got most of the machines you need for a decent workout.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25KMmQyeGlMVVZtV0VGS1EwOURXSEpsWmtKVmMxRRAB
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Nissi G.,5,"Perfectly located, well-designed, and well-equipped Anytime Fitness branch.

Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,fiko febriyan,5,"The gym is exceptionally well-maintained and pleasantly cool, thanks to the ample fans installed throughout the space. The facilities, including the toilets, are impressively clean and new.

Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Jing Feng Cheah,5,"Has a plethora of cool looking grips that feel very comfortable to hold. The dumbbells are also designed to not roll around. Overall not bad, contains all the equipment you need. Toilet has showers and good quality hair dryer as well.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pSNGNTMVlaRlJUYkd0Wk9FRllhelJ0UjIwMldXYxAB
Anytime Fitness Clarke Quay,Corentin Roux,5,"An excellent new opening filling the AF desert between City Hall and Chinatown.

2 racks + one Smith, one deadlift platform, plenty of new Hammer Strength bumper plates, Life Fitness machines with two pulldowns and one row - not huge, but enough to get a decent strength training workout done. The cardio side has the usual AF lineup of rower, stairs, elliptical and many treadmills, all modern with big screens.

The advantage of AF is of course the global network, particularly in Asia. I've worked out in small Australian towns, central Tokyo and the suburbs of Seoul. It's also 24/7 which was much appreciated in the hyper crowded Orchard and City Hall branches. If you are considering a membership, these are strong positives and not really offered by other chains.

If I were to suggest some improvements: add a couple more barbells and perhaps Eleiko competition grade ones like at Orchard and City Hall, add one more deadlift area, add a lever to load the deadlift bar, and maybe give yourself a few minutes to wipe all the new bumper plates and bars of oil. But these are very minor things. Great gym.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25kR05ERkNOamhCWTJOaFUyZG5RbmhKYURWbVptYxAB
