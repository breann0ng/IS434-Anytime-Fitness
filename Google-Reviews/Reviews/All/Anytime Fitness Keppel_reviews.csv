Anytime Fitness Keppel,Jeremy Lim,4,Decent AF outlet. 2 squat racks and 1 platform. Smaller space overall but has all the essential equipment. Rating 4/5 as their water cooler doesn’t work and there does not appear to be a proactive solution to it. Has in gym toilets.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pKamRrdGpORzVuWDNKbVoyMWZSRGxJUWt4TU9IYxAB
Anytime Fitness Keppel,fabius lee,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
From the moment I walked in, the friendly staff greeted me with warm smiles that instantly made me feel at home.

The gym itself is small but well-maintained, with a great variety of machines and free weights. Plus, the atmosphere is so positive—it’s motivating to be around other members who share the same fitness goals. I love the convenience of 24/7 access, allowing me to work out whenever it suits.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfcWJIMzFnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Keppel,Miles Shenouda,5,"Adequately equipped gym with on-site showers and toilets. The staff are consistently friendly and professional. Syarif, in particular, stands out for his warm greetings and willingness to assist gym users with any questions or support they need.

Anytime Fitness Keppel,Susan Fu,1,"Wish I can give 0 stars! Do not join at any cost !!

Firstly manager uses the gym as her own personal gym to run her own personal trainer business training her clients together with her partner. Always hogging multiple equipment and machines and talking laughing so loudly!

Secondly they are not even promoting the AF pt sessions and illegally pushing her own agenda. Was told off by her staff when I was just help my friend correcting her stating no coaching was allowed when I’m not even a PT and just barely helping my friend.

Staff don’t give a damn about gym equipment cause everything I visit the weights and plates are all over when they are 2-3 staff and nobody bothers to arrange it back properly. Why are you getting paid again?

Finally, they had a renovation taking away all shower , toilet and changing room facilities. It’s been 2 days since they promised the end of construction so when I went in to workout, after my training I asked the staff where to shower and change one of the male staff had the audacity to ask me to change in the locker area which was an open area next to the water cooler and near the lockers accessible to both men and women. I will be reporting thing directly to AF headquarters",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21sSU1rUnJUR3hVYjFWdmMxTXhTbEo1VlZKTmEwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Keppel,Nickson Wong,5,"I had 2 training session with Kal at Anytime Fitness Keppel branch (1 hour each), and I would personally recommend him. Kal has been incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and approachable. He really take into account of my request and prepare me for long endurance hiking by designing the training session to fit my goals and fitness level. He listens carefully and more than happy to guide me through each workout and always makes sure I’m pushing myself to the limit without overexerting (which may result in injury in worst case scenario).

Both session with Kal has been challenging but also enjoyable as he always takes the time to explain the purpose behind each exercise and how it may affect my hiking capacity in the long run. He’s also very attentive during my workout session, correcting my posture and making sure I'm not injure during my workout.

Additionally, the staff here is very friendly, welcoming, and professional. But I must say, please avoid peak period like 6pm-7pm it was quite crowded, though I supposed it is normal since that's the time everyone left their work and just getting into exercise for the day.

If you’re looking for a personal trainer who truly cares, and able to cater the training according to your need please look for Kal from the Keppel branch team!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25kV2MyMVZSa0phYmxGWk5uSlJkbWR4TmtkWmNrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Keppel,Daniel Ng,5,"Very small gym but gets the job done. Equipments are all clean, new and well maintained. The cardio machines all face a floor to ceiling window with natural light which is nice. Machines are all Precor branded. 2 squat racks, 1 deadlift platform and 1 smith machine. Dumbbells go up to 45kg and there's enough variety to have a decent workout.

Went in at 7.30am on a Wednesday and there was only one other user present! Only thing that can be improved is there's only one toilet, whereas there are 3 showers and you don't really have an area to freshen up, just a small sink.

Other than that, lovely gym!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0OTRhMlZREAE
Anytime Fitness Keppel,Josh D.A,5,"Have visited many AF outlets but this one spells HOME & is a sanctuary. Renovations in progress now though but that aside, i've had the pleasure of working out in Keppel's clean, organised & welcoming atmosphere. Manager & Staff are extremely knowledgeable & friendly. Also appreciate that there's no hard pushy selling but a very empathetic consultative approach by manager. Overall, refreshing experience compared to sterile commercial cookie-cutter feel of other gyms.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xkUWNHbzVibGxJYmxkV2Qyc3lhRVV4V0ZNMmQxRRAB
Anytime Fitness Keppel,Maimunah Nokman,5,"Through the SPARK PT Starter Pack, I trained with Kal and was impressed by his knowledge and experience. After every session, I left the gym feeling accomplished and made sure I learnt something new each time. I appreciate how he focuses on functional strength training, which enhances mobility, balance, and injury prevention. Additionally, his approach of incorporating more free weights and bodyweight exercises into workouts is practical—something I can also apply when travelling or exercising in environments without large machines.

I appreciate the effort Kal takes to explain the workouts we are doing, as well as the plan he puts together for each session to ensure we are making the most of our time.

If you're someone looking to start a new exercise regimen or ease back into a workout routine, I highly recommend having a conversation with Kal. His experience and dedication to helping you reach your goals truly stand out!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2kxbFNIbHpiRk56WmpScFVtTkVaMFZUY2s1TU9VRRAB

Anytime Fitness Keppel,K Daron,3,"Update 2023

This gym will charge an extra 20% if you are an existing member. The reason is due to inflation.

Other clubs has not increase the rates for existing regular members yet.

Please beware of this increase.

I would consider this gym as sub par. The new layout of the gym is terrible as the power rack and deadlift platform is cramped up in one corner.

Before 2023:

Good gym with incredible high ceilings and lighting

They have 2 Precor Racks and many benches

Barbells are Ziva Branded and weights are Ziva bumper plates and regular anytime fitness plates

Dumbbells ranges from 1-40kg

They also have fixed barbells ranging from 10-45kg

Basic gym machines are available

However, they do not have an in-house foam roller. They also do not have much variety of cable attachments and add-ons. Essential equipments that are missing: V-Bar & weighted dip belt.

Lighting is sharp and great with ground to ceiling windows that brings in lots of natural sunlight

Music selections could be better, usually the playlists are a little “too soft” for a proper strong workout

Downside is that they only have one toilet cubicle and 3 shower cubicle. The toilet cubicle is often smelly but i think that could be solved by leaving the door opened after using.

Overall a good gym with a nice atmosphere but has areas it can improve upon to be better",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPbmZ5VTdnRRAB
