Anytime Fitness Bukit Merah Central,Keith Ong,5,"New club located at Bukit Merah, it was a good experience working out here and the vibes were awesome. New equipments that feels great and ergonomic. They had a rare piece that I had not seen before at any Anytime Fitness’s which was a dual stack cable machine with a stabiliser in the middle- similar to the Cybex one. Would recommend this club to everyone.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21oMVgyRXphMFI1VjFsSWIzVnNOVGQxYTJoVU4yYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Merah Central,Sarah K,3,"While I appreciate having a 24/7 gym in this area, I was shocked and disappointed that they only had essentially one cable pulley system (because no two people would want to squeeze at one machine). Triceps Pushdown is a rather common exercise. Now I always have to wait to use the machine. Another common exercise is the Lat Pulldown which they also don't have the machine for.

Noted that they are adding more machines in dec/jan, but that's 4-5 months of not being able to complete my routine... It's also a stickler for me that there's no fan built into the treadmill... Most machines seem to be made for taller individuals (not asian-sized). Looking forward to improvements that deserve a change in my review.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pnMWNUTmlNV2xoYkU1RllqTnpXbUZKZWtwdFlYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Merah Central,Vani,1,"The staff told us different things in real life, and when I clarified on Whatsapp - there was just a message ""looks like there is a miscommunication"" no apology or anything. Overall the attitude of the staff in this AF is disappointing. I did not like their attitude in handling customer queries. On the week of fob collection, I even had to ask about it. No updates from Whatsapp from their end till the day I saw on their IG ""come fob and freebies collect tomorrow"". No initiative from the start till I ask about it, then receive Whatsapp message. I regret signing up with this branch. Other AFs staff is 100000 times better. Will be changing",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21ORE9HWnNjV3hKVEdwVVNVUkNUR3hJTm01WFZtYxAB
