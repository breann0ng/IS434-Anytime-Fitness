Anytime Fitness Bukit Batok (Le Quest),Benedict Correya,5,"I've been a member here since last month and I'm really liking it so far. The gym is compact but clean and well-maintained, with all the essential equipment you’d expect—from free weights to cardio and strength machines.

Even though it’s not a large space, it doesn’t feel too crowded most of the time. The 24/7 access is super convenient, and the location inside Le Quest makes it easy to combine workouts with errands or meals.

The staff are approachable and helpful during staffed hours, and the environment feels welcoming for both new and experienced gym-goers. A solid choice for anyone living in the area or looking for a quiet and convenient place to train.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21Odk4yRkpiV2hZYjBaQlgySnNRVzgwUVd4dlZYYxAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Batok (Le Quest),XH Lin,5,"It is my first visit into this AF Bukit Batok (Le Quest) gym.
I am very impressed by the usage of the space of this gym. This gym has many functional equipments. I loved the layout of the equipments in this space. This AF Bukit Batok (Le Quest) gym has 2 shower rooms too. The shower rooms are well maintained too. Bring your own shower gel, hair wash and towel if you need to use their shower rooms.
Lastly, I am impressed by the owner of this gym as he can greet each member as they step into the gym space. I can see the effort to keep this gym space  a welcoming one for members to do their workouts.
I will definitely visit this gym again when I am around their neighbourhood. 👍",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYLTllMzhnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Batok (Le Quest),Josiah,5,"Signed up with AFLQ slightly over a month ago and definitely can say that it’s one of the better gyms I’ve been to. The staff are fantastic — always friendly, efficient, and genuinely willing to help with workout tips or form corrections. You can tell they really care about members’ progress and comfort.

The gym is very well-maintained, with machines and other equipment all in excellent condition. Albeit on the smaller side, the layout makes excellent use of the space, and offers a solid mix of machines and training options that would satisfy most workout routines.

What I like most is the welcoming, non-intimidating atmosphere. Whether you’re new to the gym or experienced, you’ll feel comfortable here. Crowd is also pretty well spaced out in the afternoons, basically little to no waiting time for equipment.

Highly recommended if you’re looking for convenience within the vicinity with a well-maintained gym, AFLQ is a great choice to consider!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWUVNIVkRWRnB0ZFhodlVYQlNXVkI0YVhaNlpHYxAB

One of the co-owner provided me with guidance as a goodwill gesture on my first day at the gym and that really helped establish my confidence for attending gym sessions on my own subsequently. Staff members are friendly, professional and take effort to remember individual members’ names and would strike up conversations where appropriate.

Anytime Fitness Bukit Batok (Le Quest),MM Home,5,"Review: Le Quest Anytime Fitness

Equipment: The gym has all the essentials I need. Equipment is well-maintained and “NEW”, so I never have to worry about something not working when I need it. And there is a new equipment coming on 9-Sept. Looking forward to it!

Cleanliness: I really appreciate how clean the gym is being maintained. The staff does a fantastic job keeping everything sanitized, and I always see other members wiping down machines after use. It gives me peace of mind knowing the environment is safe and hygienic.

Environment: The atmosphere here is welcoming and comfortable. Whether I’m in the mood for a solo workout or need some advice, the owners, YC and YS is always friendly and available to help. The other members are also respectful, which makes working out here a positive experience every time.

All in all, Le Quest AF provides exactly what I’m looking for in a gym: convenience, cleanliness, and a friendly environment. If you’re like me and value 24/7 access along with the basics for a great workout, I’d highly recommend Le Quest AF.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIcU9qQ0tREAE

Anytime Fitness Bukit Batok (Le Quest),SG lee,5,"I’m so glad to have found Anytime Fitness right in my neighborhood. A big thank you to Mr. Y.S. who warmly came out to welcome me when I was just looking in from outside. If not for his kind approach, I probably wouldn’t have stepped in to enquire.

At the age of 61, I finally began my workout journey—and I’ve been coming for over a month now. The coaches, Mr. Fiq and Mr. Tin Wei, have been incredibly approachable, patient, and helpful. Thanks to their encouragement and support, I feel comfortable and motivated to work out 3 to 4 times a week.

Thank you, Anytime Fitness team, for creating such a welcoming and supportive environment for someone like me starting later in life. It’s never too late to begin!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pjNGRrSkVOUzFuZFRaaGRXaFdUVEpzTUZjd1QxRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Batok (Le Quest),W,1,"If there is A minus 5 stars option, I would have gladly given it. On 26 June 2025 8pm, I was doing my walks around the estate and stumbled on this gym outlet. Door was opened and I was curious if I should join as a member - always been a Fitness First loyal.

Met Ding Wei the centre operator , not sure of his role there but it's completely appalling the way he treats potential customers. Here's why:

1. He told me I got to pay $65 for a penalty for entering the narrow joint without a key (door was opened by the way).

2. Proceeded to tell me I dirtied his floor by walking into the gym (now that's new and I was not treading mud in or whatever). I examined his accusations and in front of all the customers he wanted to start this ruckus so I offered sarcastically to mop his whole floor for him. Ridiculous I know.

3. I then use the centre's sanitiser spray as I had touched the steel bars and Ding Wei (wearing his All saints t shirt - funny to me because it's a funeral parlour famous in Singapore), announced loudly in front of all the gym clients, that I cannot use the sanitiser as it is company's property. I felt like he really is the worst person to be put as a front line face of the brand. I had always good impressions of anytime fitness until Ding Wei (Le Qu'est).

It's a bewildering experience and this is a neutral report. If he is the boss or actual franchisee, in a word it is boondoggle and a sacrilege. Ok more than a word. I could think of more but you catch my drift.

Kindly if the management is reading this, put someone more emotionally intelligent (at least 1000x more) to deal with potential sign ups and customers. As a business person myself, I would have rotated him to other roles (backend) instead of being the supposed charmer who gets in the sales and hitting targets, as any business owner wants.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25salZVZG9RMjFZYzJvNVltVkpOWHAxZDFWSFMxRRAB

ATP I'm being nitpicky but the machine choices definitely aren't the best and I could definitely get a better stretch from the machines at the near CSC and Hong Kah outlets . You could always use the dumbbells to make up for this though.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvaTdfZE1REAE

Wonderful staff services as they were super patient in explaining the details to me, even going the extra length to check on me when I seem to be struggling with equipments and decisions.

Great advice and recommendations and overall a positive vibes place.
