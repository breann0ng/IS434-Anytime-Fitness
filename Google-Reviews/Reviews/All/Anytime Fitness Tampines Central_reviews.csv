Anytime Fitness Tampines Central,mustaqim shah,5,"Anytime Fitness Tampines Central honestly feels like a second home. The moment you walk in, you’re welcomed with big smiles and good vibes all around. The staff and manager are super friendly and always full of energy, they never fail to greet everyone, and that small gesture really makes a difference.

The atmosphere is super chill and welcoming, and the members here are just as nice. Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been working out for years, you’ll definitely feel comfortable and included. The gym is always clean, and the lounge area is a great place to just hang out or unwind after a workout.

What I love most is how this place makes you feel. Every time I step into the gym, I feel encouraged, supported, and genuinely happy to be there. If you’re looking for a gym with a great vibe and awesome people, this is the place to be!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJeF9yeC1nRRAB

Anytime Fitness Tampines Central,Jiawei W.,1,"Staff there including the outlet manager are rude, inflexible and unaccommodating. Gym is not especially well equipped and whatever equipments are there tend to be old and worn. Not really a pleasant place to workout.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJZ2FTdUFREAE
Anytime Fitness Tampines Central,Jamson Tan Han Yang,3,"The gym offers a decent amount of space, but it suffers from poor management and inadequate equipment availability. During my visit, I noticed several instances of people occupying machines for extended periods—over 20 minutes—while using their phones or taking unnecessary breaks, such as going to the toilet between sets.

Additionally, there was an insufficient number of 2.5 kg weight plates, which was frustrating for those needing smaller increments for their workouts. I strongly recommend implementing clear rules and signs to discourage machine hogging, perhaps by setting a maximum usage time per machine during peak hours. It would also help to have clear signage directing Anytime Fitness (AF) members to the lounge area for better accessibility.

While the gym has potential, these issues detract from the overall experience. I wouldn’t return unless absolutely necessary.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQbmRHUnhnRRAB
