Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Kameshwari Rajakrishnan,3,"i actually like this gym .   while the area is large ( great for mat workouts !)  the cardio machines, cable machines, and free weights are in varying states of much needed maintenance, with rust on some machines, and the flooring at free weights area so well-loved and well-used, there are dips and uneven surfaces.But most equipment remain useable with gloves  and standing near a fan helps with ventilation. friendly suggestion: do ensure your jabs for tetanus are up to date.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Desmond,2,"New-ish AF member, and while this Northpoint branch has its location perks, like many have said, the equipment status and ventilation are not as ideal. And while visiting it tonight, noticed the only water dispenser is also out of service. Its a gym and people need their hydration, and even that can also be out of service. And I had to make a detour to get some water from nearby Cheers before starting exercise. Very jialat.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Liyana Ali,1,"It has been over three weeks, and no service has been carried out for the treadmills. As of now, five treadmills are still marked as “pending” or “under maintenance.” This long delay is disappointing and inconvenient for members who depend on them for their workouts. Regular maintenance and prompt service should be a basic standard, especially for paying members. Please improve.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Shiyam Johar,1,"I have been visiting this gym on weekends over the past 2 years. Although I do not write reviews often, thought of sharing an overall view based on my experience.

Location: extremely good - whether you are using public transportation or driving. I will surely get parking even during the peak hours. Very good foot traffic.

Space: quite a large space and not crowded even during peak times.

Equipment: hardly maintained. There are 3-4  treadmills (out of 8) not working for over 6 months. No efforts made to maintain other equipment too. Old dumbells and machines.

Comfort: recently it seems that there are a big issue with the cooling system. The gym is extremely hot and suffocating. I can see some members fanning themselves or moving close to ceiling fans to cool themselves.

Bathrooms: honestly disgusting to see that the cleaning lady often splashes buckets of water on the floor. Other than that, its ok.

Staff: hardly see any staff in the gym. Whoever is there, remains in the office space. Not proactive or seeking any improvement as I see.

Conclusion: fantastic location but Management must change and a face-lift is urgently required",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,okay can,1,"Been a while since I came here, but I remember when I was waiting outside the main office, the short muscular Chinese staff came up to us all aggressive like he wanted to fight, for no reason. All the staff in addition had 0 customer service capabilities, especially this guy. Does not help that if I remember correctly, I was near some newbies that wanted to sign up.

This, on top of the shitty maintenance (with machines always down despite charging so much money), convinced me to drop my membership with AF.

One more thing to note is the poor use of space. So much space for so many things barely anybody uses, but so limited hugh demand equipment like chest fly machine. If it would be so crowded, why even use AF? ActiveSG Canberra is much cheaper and has a better equipment layout.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Mr Nice,2,"Honest review, the place is huge and equipment are sufficient enough where you need not wait to do complete sets. Downside for me in deducting 3 stars, the freeweights area is very rundown and the dumbells are rusty. The padding on the floor over there uneven, to the point of hazardous. Please help to maintain the flooring before someone gets hurt. The other areas, crossfit area, machines, cardio machines, freerack barbell area of 4 i believe, are sufficient but its all worned out. The air conditioning is pretty weak. I can actually get drenched at the freeweights area. Management, you need to ensure the basic maintainance is done cause you will lose more members. Great location, poor maintainance.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Daron Lee,1,"one of the worst AF. despite being one of the largest branches, it is a waste of space and resources.

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Hung Hao,4,"As anytime fitness outlets pop up across Singapore like I’m sure many are curious to compare how different outlets are like- and I have done exactly that in my little review over here.

First of all, excellent facilities- I counted a grand total of 6 squat racks. Half had the powerlifting platform.

There’s also 6/7 treadmills. 2 stair masters, 4 ellipticals. A solid number to fulfill the cardio needs of a large gym like this.

Oh! I was also surprised at the large space provided for changing needs. 6-7 bathrooms (fully equipped with a shower and a toilet and basin). It’s good for those who want to be squeaky clean.

Dumbbells are also aplenty. They use a older kind of dumbbell which is more elongated in shape (rather than being compact)- I can’t explain it but it makes sense trust me. Works just as well but not as lovely as the newer dumbbells.

Esoteric machines like for accessory movements are also available. Tricep push downs/bicep curls machine are here. 😆😆.

Huge space for functional fitness- think kettlebells, pull ups, yada yada. All the space in the world for your farmers carry.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Chuin Ann,1,"I have been a member of this gym for 12 months, and my experience has been nothing short of disappointing. The facility is poorly maintained, with rusty equipment and chipped dumbbells that are not only unsightly but also a potential safety hazard. The gym plates are often dirty, adding to the overall lack of cleanliness. The uneven gym floor is another major issue, making it unsafe for workouts.

The poor air conditioning only adds to the discomfort, making the gym environment unbearable at times. Despite these glaring issues, the management shows no interest in maintaining the facility or addressing these concerns.

Additionally, their treatment of existing customers is extremely unsatisfactory. After my 12-month contract ended, I hoped to renew my membership at a better rate. Instead, I was informed that my membership auto-renews without any end, and they refused to offer me a better price, while new members are given promotional rates.

When I raised these concerns, the staff's response was dismissive, asking, ""how do you wish to go on about this,"" rather than offering any solutions. Ultimately, when I decided to terminate my membership, they showed no interest in retaining me as a customer and simply told me to send an email.

Overall, this gym does not value its members, and I cannot recommend it to anyone looking for a well-maintained facility and respectful customer service.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,regina deang,1,"I have been to four AF outlets, and this is the only one where I felt humiliated. One of their staff members kicked me out simply for forgetting my key fob, despite being a member of their gym. I understand that I *may* not be allowed to enter without my key fob, but can this outlet at least be compassionate and polite when speaking to members about this? I’m not expecting to be treated like royalty, just as a decent human being with emotions.

Other gym brands have more convenient ways of accessing the gym, like logging in through their phone app. Additionally, other AF gym outlets are more considerate when members forget their key fob (note: it's not about being non-compliant, but about being considerate). I tried to raise this concern with their management, but I think they’re tone-deaf on the issue. They cannot even do a proper customer service response. It’s not like we’re going there to rob them.

I’m tired of the ""take it or leave it"" mentality. It was very frustrating that I had to wait two months to transfer to another gym with better customer service. It was also disappointing that I paid for an additional two months at this gym, only to be treated as though I should be grateful just to be a member of their “special gym”.

I’m glad I’m no longer a member. Best of luck to the current members or those who want to sign up.",Date not found

I was a repeat Member from years ago, and have been to many outlets but this outlet is just beyond horrible.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Ernest See,2,"Having been to this gym for almost two years, there are a few things to take note:

The gym equipment, especially the plates are quite musty and almost sticky. Just by touching the plates alone and your hand would turn brown or black. There is also a relatively sourish stink from some of the machines, like the pec deck fly machine or the lateral raise machine. There are also faults on machines that I have raised before a month or two back, where there are cables that are tearing, especially in the seated leg curl machine. It has still not been fixed, and its almost 3 months already.

Next are random leaks around the gym. If you look up in the deeper areas of the gym away from the entrances, you can see that there are water pipes that running in the ceiling. Some of these pipes leak frequently, especially around the lateral raise machine or the sled leg press. There can be watermarks on the floor near those areas and sometimes on the machine when the staff have not wiped the stains off the machine.

Lastly, would be the air conditioning. Since it is a mall, the aircon is actually rather decent in the gym during from about 9am to 11pm. However, beyond those timings the airconditioning would be turned off. There has been multiple complaints to the management saying that this issue would be resolved, yet nothing has been done for literal years. I have came to gym in wee hours in the morning (around 5-6am) and holy crap the temperatures are unbearable. It also gets rather humid since there is no ventilation within the gym at all, and people that gym during those timings will be found camping around the fans that are around in the gym. If you would like to gym in the early hours, please do not come to this gym.

However, I would also like to say that the staff are rather friendly and kind especially with new gym-goers. They also provide Ajwa Dates during the Ramadan period for Muslims that are gymming near or after the break fast period, which is a good sign to see. There are also many toilets around, about 7 toilets with 6 of them with shower facilities. The water coolers there are also functional, although the one nearest to the vending machine only has room temperature water as the cooling is not effective or has broken down.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,YQ Oh,2,This gym has a spacious floor area and wider range of equipment than most AF branches. Unfortunately it is let down by poor maintenance. The place has a moisture issue as the machines and weights were all rusty. The air was stagnant and stuffy leaving you damp.

This place could be much better with a revamp and some TLC from the management.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,David Yap,1,"Poor maintenance of equipment:

1. 1 pair of 10KG ZIVA dumbbells missing since August 2020. Management has been citing delays as the cause with no updates on the replacement as of today.

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Juztin Png,1,"This is my return to join the gym after COVID. And I'm surprise how bad shape the gym is now compared to I first joined them just only about 3 yrs ago....

Still the same old space, pretty big and spacious. Not very crowded during off peak hrs. That's about all the good I can say...

Machines (especially treadmills) is always down and took them forever to fix (only putting up the same old notice of waiting for spare parts... Wondering did they even follow up with supplier since I joined back for 2 month plus, still the notice is there).
Most treadmill, their touchscreen is not even functioning at all...
Aircon in the gym is bad... Really bad... It totally not cooling at all and there isn't enough fans round. After 45 mins on treadmill, my shoes is soaked up with sweat (worst than I run outdoor).
Air is pretty stale and damp in the gym.

And I do agreed to most comments here that the staffs can be pretty rude. There is once I entered the gym, this male staff sitting in the office, just stand up,  give me a hand gesture (like calling a pet) to go into the office, just to check my key fob.
If any random check is required to be conducted, have your staff to at least walk to the office door and ask politely! Not using hand gesture like an officer instructing a criminal or a boss calling his subordinate to his office. He is not my boss or officer!

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,JY,1,"Ella is not doing any good to this organization. Frankly, she is totally not suitable to do sales.

I enquired about joining the gym as a friend referred. My friend told me he can get 1 month free if I join by quoting him. I found out that currently, Anytime Fitness is waiving off the joining fees. However, for the outlet in Nortpoint City, for them to honor one free month for my friend who referred, I have to pay joining fees.

I am upset as they are using my money to give one month free to my friend. This is totally not right.

To me, Ella couldn't handle objections. Doesn't even bother selling the benefits of the gym.

I really hope the owner can really consider if Ella is suitable for the job. Clearly, she is pushing customers away. There are so many other gyms in Singapore. If you don't show interests in having my business, you will lose it completely. Not only she gave Anytime Fitness Northpoint City a bad name, she doesn't represent Anytime Fitness well.

She made me totally don't want to consider joining Anytime Fitness. She made Anytime Fitness lose a customer who is ready and eager to join.

Seriously the management should really consider if she is suitable for the role. Frankly, she does not represent Anytime Fitness well. Any potential leads if handled by her will also turn cold.

Suggest the boss to use mystery shoppers to test the response of their staff. In this competitive world, not having the right sales personnel will be more damaging than not have any sales personnel.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Tim,1,"Asked for a free trial specifically to exercise with the equipments, and when I reached there I was suddenly told it was just a tour and not a trial. Made me waste time prepping the workout before and coming all the way down. Had to find another gym to do my workout that morning.

Granted it was a miscom, I was open to come back another day for a trial before signing up, but the saleperson that I spoke via text gave bad attitude and was not apologetic at all, and that it was me who didn't read the poster that he sent me for the trial timings. Like hello, I came mentioning for a trial explicitly, and you sidestepped it into just a tour instead. How can a new customer know what's the diff between a tour and trial if you don't even bother to explain, and say its ok to come down when I asked for a trial? And he still had the gall to say I could have just signed up on the spot, then can use the gym straightaway.

Very bad customer service.. Looking at the reviews here about how the management is rude to even their existing members, and how they don't bother to maintain the equipment, I am glad I had this encounter before I signed.

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,dominicpoh,1,"Unfortunately, my worst experience as an AF member. Membership was transferred here since I moved around here; I’ve been with AF since 2017. Been to many outlets but this is the first time im leaving a negative review.

Pros
1. Location. Inside northpoint.
2. 6 racks.
3. Huge space.

Cons
1. Since it’s within a mall, I believe much of their aircon is dependent on the mall’s aircon source (?). For early gym goers like myself, the gym is a sauna. Many of us will be camping around fans in between sets lol.

2. Equipment. Spoilt. Rusty. Smelly. To name a few. One the machine was spoilt throughout the duration I’ve been a member with them (around 2 months). Some of the accessories at the cable machine is really… smelly

3. No customer service at all. I’m not usually particular about this but it really feels like the staffs there are “business-centric”. After joining, they straight away increased my membership price due to 8% GST though my previous outlet absorbed it lol. Received another email for price hike again this month. When I transferred to other outlets previously, l felt very welcomed, they even offered mini welcome gifts. Staffs will always smile and wave goodbye when you leave. Nothing of such here haha unless probably you know the staffs personally. In conclusion, very prompt in their finance management.

Basically they’re the only Anytime Fitness management in Singapore to raise their rates, and nothing we can do about it since out membership is already with them.
GREEDY MANAGEMENT WHO OBVIOUSLY CARE MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN THEIR MEMBERS.

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,ChoonSeang Tan,1,One of most expensive yet poorly maintained AF gym.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,A. L,2,Quality is acceptable but not great. Only has one barbell that has grip in centre for squats. The rest of the barbells does not have grip on centre which means it might slip on your back if you're not careful or using lowbar position. I always try to go during off peak. My main complaint would be all the powerlifters hogging onto all the squat rack and platforms. These guys would sit around for at least 1 hour or more at the racks which is ridiculous . Management should enforce non hogging policies.,Date not found

Equipments are great too! Until today as i was leaving the gym, i plan to buy a gym towel there as kind of want it? I ask one of the staff which he's a big indian looking guy. Certainly not being racist, my bad if im describing the staff like that. And so i proceeded to ask him

Senario:

Me : Hi, may i know how much is a gym towel?
Staff : Sorry, im busy. You can ask my colleagues about it.
Me : ... left the gym.

I mean, i get it i know you're busy with a client. But you could at least give a more polite reply instead of turning away fast after a sentence? Overall everything in the gym is great. Just wanna point out something i experience today.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Chua Weijun,1,"Do do do do do read the term and conditions when signing up with anytime fitness Yishun. I didn’t really read the term and conditions and took what the salesperson said as granted. As a result I am unable to cancel my membership as promised.

When signing up for the membership I told the person who liaised with me that I am sort of injured, I am worried that by signing up 2 years package I might not be able to sustain throughout the entire duration. I was reassured that I can cancel my membership foc if I have a doc memo.

True indeed I torn my meniscus in the midst of gyming. As such I was force to pause at a rate of close to 40/mth for few months before they finally agree to freeze my membership foc.

Subsequently I unfreeze my membership with the hope that I can return back to gym but my body really can’t take it. My physio recommended me to stop gyming and start swimming. I tried to ask them if I can cancel my membership with a physio memo and they of course rejected it. They say they can only accept doctor memo be it specialist or GP. Cancel with a fee of 107 sgd. I am actually okay with it cause of sort of give up in anytime fitness salesman and I requested if to head down with a audio recorder to record this and share with my friends. Just to warn them about some sales techniques. This is when they got aggressive. All good though cause I will still write a full blown article about this and share it soon!

Take care when signing up. Think twice!",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Northpoint City,Ninja master1140,1,"Came to the gym today , the experience was sub par to a gym standard. The gym was humid and hot , air con was not strong enough. Was already sweating even with the fan blasting at full speed ; training just like old school where air con was non existent.

The gym layout was spacious , functional area was big too but did not have the resistance bands for warm ups or foam rollers to cool down.

Equipment wise - Majority of the cables , weights and kettlebells was SUPER Rusty which might be uncomfortable to work out with due to the amount of metallic rust. Seems the weights and cables was not been properly oiled and cleaned hence a lot of the machines was madly rusted.

Weights - Other then the colour bumpers plates which was ok , the other weighted plates was tearing off and the plates is worn and tear so might need to upgrade.

Water Dispenser - There was a water disruption so need to provide water bottles for members.

Toilets and Showers was cordoned off due to some renovation works so need to use the malls toilets.

Vending Machine - Cans will pop out if drop from heights , therefore will cause the drink to spill out. Not sure how to cushion the drink when it drops after purchasing.

Treadmills - Ok ok

Changing Rooms - Ok Ok

Overall The gym really needs an immediate renovation to upgrade the machines and weights. Too rusty and the carpentry looks updated as compared to other AF Outlets.

Overall Gym - 3/ 10
Machines -  5/10
Humidity - 1/10

Worst AF in the north especially in Yishun.",Date not found
