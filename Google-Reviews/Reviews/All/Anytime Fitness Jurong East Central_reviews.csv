Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,anas syakir,5,"If you’re looking for a gym that feels like family, look no further and that’s largely thanks to Leonard. From the moment you walk in, Leonard doesn’t just greet you he welcomes you like a brother coming home. His warmth, genuine care, and unshakeable positivity transform what could be just another workout space into a true second home.

Leonard treats everyone equally whether you’re a new member or a regular with respect, kindness, and infectious enthusiasm. He remembers your name, asks about your day, and celebrates your progress like it’s his own victory. There’s no ego here, just pure support. He doesn’t see members as clients he sees them as a friend.

What sets Leonard apart isn’t just his professionalism, which is top-tier but his ability to make every interaction meaningful. He’ll encourage you when you’re struggling, share a laugh when you need it, and always make time to listen. You never feel like just another face in the crowd you feel seen, valued, and truly cared for.

The gym can be an intimidating place for many, but Leonard dissolves that fear instantly. He radiates a vibe of acceptance and camaraderie that makes you want to show up. It’s rare to find someone who embodies the spirit of community like he does. He doesn’t just work here he builds a home here, one smile, one conversation, one act of kindness at a time.

Leonard, you’re not just staff you’re the soul of this gym. Thank you for making every workout feel like a reunion with family. This place wouldn’t be the same without you.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Jerry Shi,1,"I’m honestly shocked by how bad this gym is. First of all, the place smells awful — like sweat and mold that’s never been cleaned. It hits you the second you walk in and makes the whole workout experience miserable. But even worse than the smell is the attitude of the staff. They are incredibly rude, dismissive, and clearly have no interest in helping anyone, especially beginners. If you’re new or just trying to get started on your fitness journey, don’t expect any support here. Instead of offering guidance or encouragement, they look down on you like you don’t belong.

To make things even more frustrating, they refused to honor the free trial that they advertise. When we asked about it, the staff brushed us off with a bad attitude and told us it wasn’t available — no explanation, no apology, just straight-up discrimination. It felt like they were picking and choosing who they allowed to join, and that’s completely unacceptable.

This gym is unprofessional, unfriendly, and feels like a toxic environment. I would never recommend it to anyone — especially not to beginners or people just trying to get healthier. Save your money and your time. There are plenty of gyms that actually care about their members — this is not one of them.

This gym provides a very poor experience overall. The facility smells bad, the staff are rude and unwelcoming—especially toward beginners—and they refused to honor the advertised free trial. Their behavior felt discriminatory and unprofessional, making the gym an uninviting and toxic environment. This is not a place that supports new members or encourages a positive fitness journey.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Aiden Yang,1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience

I had a terrible and frustrating experience at this gym. From the moment I walked in, the staff were rude, unwelcoming, and dismissive, especially toward beginners. Instead of offering guidance or support, they made me feel uncomfortable and out of place.

Their attitude was unprofessional, and they showed zero interest in helping new members get started or feel included. It’s clear that if you’re not already an advanced gym-goer, you’re not welcome here.

The facilities are lacking as well — outdated equipment, poor cleanliness, and a generally neglected environment. There’s no sense of community or encouragement, which is vital for anyone trying to start or continue their fitness journey. the area is small

Worst of all, I felt extremely discriminated against, which made the whole experience not just unpleasant, but deeply upsetting. No one should feel judged or unwelcome when they’re trying to improve themselves.",Date not found

Not sure why the bad reviews. I agree that the air con slightly not on the cooler spectrum, it tends to get warm during mid days when it’s humid weather.

Also some people are just arse— leaving equipments around after their workout sets!! Where is the basic gym etiquette!! Please Take note GYM JE management!

Things to improve—adding one extra adjustable bench at the free weight area would be good as two benches tend to use up in the two racks during peak hours. This means not just one person is training at free weight area during peak hours and reducing traffic as gymers could get their workout done and leave.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Lee Marcus,3,"Comparing to other Anytime Fitness I have been this gym meets all required facilities with some slight issues due to limited space or poor ""tetris-ing"".

However, there are some flaws that stood out after visiting other branches.
Gym Equipment:
1) Only 2-3 free Bench can be places at free weights area. (Probably an issue during peak hours only)
2) Only 2 Rope Attachment with 1 Cable machine and another tricep cable machine

Improved to 3.5 stars. Gym Owner is kind enough to ask for feedback and have been rectifying issues urgently. There is urgency to improve the gym for its users. Please be patient and give this gym a chance!

1) Aircon is now on 24/7

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Paul Chin,1,"Run away at all cost, when you see this Anytime Fitness branch gym centre at 134 Jurong gateway. It's frustrating and nasty when they don't allow you to end your contract as agreed upon during the sign-up period. They will play dumb when you want to terminate the contract whenever the minimum contact period has met. Having to wait until the last month and visit them in person to cancel seems unnecessary. They should honor the specific period you signed up for and make the cancellation process more convenient for their members.
What the other members commented here in Google reviews about Jasmine (probably is a fake name pretend by a guy) is true. They will purposely mislead you not wanting you to cancel your membership period on time, try to drag longer than it supposed to end, let you pay extra for the membership. And mocking you say that if you don't like installment, why don't you pay lump sum amount when you signed up with them? This is how they treat their customers? This is how they run business? We hope they are no more victims. Anyone who have gotten this kind of treatment, should go to CASE to report them.. This kind of business should not be existed anymore in Singapore.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Vivian Han,1,"Terrible Service and Poor Communication at Anytime Fitness Jurong East

I had an extremely disappointing experience with Anytime Fitness Jurong East regarding my membership cancellation. About a month ago, their staff informed me that I needed to book a face-to-face appointment to cancel my membership and serve the required 1-month notice period. I followed their instructions, scheduled the appointment, and thought everything was settled.

Fast forward to today—my last day of membership—and I was suddenly informed that they couldn’t process the cancellation from their end. Instead, I was told at the last minute that I needed to liaise with my home club to finalize the cancellation.

This is completely irresponsible and unprofessional. Why wasn’t this communicated earlier? Why ask me to come down for an appointment if they couldn’t handle the process? It’s a waste of my time and reflects poor management and coordination.

I expected much better service from a gym of this scale. Extremely dissatisfied and would not recommend this branch to anyone looking for reliability and professionalism.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,ty pang,1,"Terrible experience with this gym! Think twice before you sign up. Their service is a huge letdown (especially Jasmine).

Here's the deal: They automatically renew your contract, no matter how long you joined for. But guess what? Canceling that renewal is a nightmare! I signed up for 6 months, thinking it'd be easy to end. But oh boy, was I wrong! When I tried to cancel, there were all these hidden rules. In the end, they forced me to pay for an extra month. And get this: They say you can cancel if you move far away. But guess what? There's no way to do it! I couldn't even end the renewal on time! Seriously, if I can't finish my 6-month membership in 6 months, why do they call it that?

I told them I wanted to cancel early, but they said I had to wait until the last month. But by then, I'd be long gone from Singapore. Can you believe it? They acted like they were doing me a favor by allowing a virtual cancellation. None of this cancellation stuff is in the contract, but their staff keeps insisting on it. It's just nonsense!

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Matthew Tse,5,"I cannot say enough positive things about my personal trainer, Reece! He has truly transformed my gym experience and changed my lifestyle!

Reece's dedication and expertise have been instrumental in helping me reach my fitness goals. His tailored workouts and nutritional guidance have been spot-on, and I've seen remarkable progress since I started training with him.

What sets Reece apart, though, is how he's made the gym a better place for everyone. He's not just a trainer; he's a motivator and a source of positive energy. He creates an inclusive and welcoming environment, making sure everyone feels comfortable and encouraged, regardless of their fitness level.

His passion for fitness is contagious, and it's evident that he genuinely cares about his clients' well-being. Reece's support goes beyond the gym sessions; he's always available to answer questions, provide guidance, and offer that extra bit of motivation when you need it most.

As a personal trainer, he also works hard to improve himself. Ever since I started training with him, I witnessed how much I changed and he too, become better and stronger! Seeing how he trains himself, I am inspired to push further too!

If you're looking for a personal trainer who not only helps you achieve your fitness goals but also makes your gym experience enjoyable and inspiring, Reece is the one! I can't recommend him enough. Thank you, Reece, for making the gym a better place for all of us! 💪🏋️‍♂️👏

P.S. Although the gym is getting hotter and stuffier recently, and the management does not seem to care, Reece's dedication and positive energy definitely made up for it! Hopefully the management will review and fix the fans and aircon to make the gym an even better place for everyone! Thank you Reece for changing my lifestyle to a better, healthier one. Looking forward to more sessions with you! The 5 stars are all for Reece btw. 😊",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Meizi Lim,1,"This place don’t even deserve 1 star.

Signed up back when they first started their outlet here. The reviews here about Jasmine and her management team is relatable to my experience:

1. Back when safe-entry was implemented, her device was faulty, hence many members were stuck outside during unstaffed hours. She called me to reprimand me for opening the door for the members (yes, i understand AF’s tailgating issue, but they were all regulars I’ve seen, and they were obv stuck outside >10mins seeking for my help). Faulty device issue has already been raised before this, and nothing has been done. Instead, Jasmine demanded me to pass MY phone to each of the members to ask them to scan in manually in the middle of my workout????? (don’t even have the courtesy to allow me to finish my reps).

2. Few weeks later, I was the only few in the gym. Jasmine called me AGAIN, to ask me open the door for her contractor as no staffs were around. Hello??? I’m not a staff there???? This is a violation of customer’s PDPA, used for unintended purposes?
Also, Isn’t it contradicting to point 1?

3. Jasmine replied to the reviews saying they’re fake accounts trying to bring down her gym. Firstly, even if their records wasn’t shown in your system, members of other AF outlets are entitled to leave a review too. Secondly, always viewing from a victimised POV instead of thinking of ways to improve shows how you got your 2.6stars on google.

No, don’t tell me you can’t find my name in your system because I’ve decided to transfer to other branch who deserves the monthly fees better. Good luck with your 2.6 star gym.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Jennifer Cing,5,"Joined the gym cause of its discount. But when I went for the opening, the trainer Allan was sharing with me about how I can strengthen my ankle and shoulder as I have hurt them before. I was convinced that I should try it out, and if it does not,  it will still help my overall body look. So I signed up for 10 sessions and my Trainer Allan, has been going slowly with me to ensure that I am able to and correctly do each exercises to focus on my trouble (ankle and shoulder) area.

He advises you on what you should do and what food should you focus on. If you are looking for a trainer and is new to gym just like me. Check him out.Give him a chance to do his magic.",Date not found

There is a fee for $85 for the key fob and $95 for initiation. If you are only needing a 1-month membership like I was, then this turns into $335 for 1-month.

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,E L,1,"If possible, do consider signing up with other outlet. Personally we are quite displease with the customer journey. Presale is awesome until you have sign up with them.

The mentioned opening date was at Sep 2021 but it have since been delayed till no tomorrow (end Oct 2021 as we are speaking.) What i mean is that if there is a delay its fine but i strongly feel that its the outlet responsibility to provide prompt notice to the newly signed up members. Instead you can see more effort are being put in to acquire new members.

They have also directed us to their social page for any updates and all i can see is the countdown to end of sale rather that the status update.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Jurong East Central,Leonard Chan,1,"I've signed up for 10 personal training sessions with PT Alan. Alan has been extremely enthusiastic and encouraging, and I feel like he truly does care for me and my goals. Alan is also very knowledgeable about the different muscle groups and guides and ensures that I am working out and activating the correct muscle groups. Alan also regularly checks in with me to remind me of my goals, progress and nutrition needs in between sessions. With his dedication to the health of his clients, I strongly encourage a PT package with Alan.

Update review: Originally 5 stars due to service rendered by PT Alan (he's the only saving grace for this gym). I wrote into their business WhatsApp number asking for a freeze in membership as I just had a circumcision procedure done. While the doctor gave me an MC for 7 days to allow me to rest at home from work, I was given a info sheet that states that I'm not supposed to do anything strenuous for at least 4 weeks after the procedure. However, management has declined my request for freezing my membership as they only see the 7 days of MC and do not consider the fact that all surgical procedures require more rest than the typical hospitalisation leave or medical leave given by doctors. It's akin to me receiving 21 days of hospitalisation leave after fracturing of my arm, then saying, oh because you only have 21 days so I will only give you 21 days of frozen membership - expecting a user to be able to utilise the gym after 21 days. It is easy to do a quick google to verify that any man who undergoes circumcision requires at least 4 weeks of rest. I'm extremely disappointed and appalled at such service. This encounter truly took the cake of all the disappointments that I've not voiced since the pre-sales period. I would rather pay a higher amount per month at another gym with more understanding and empathetic management. I wouldn't recommend signing up to this branch as it seems they do not have a case by case assessment of potential issues customers may face. Truly a disappointment.",Date not found
