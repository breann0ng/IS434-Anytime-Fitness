Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,Elton Koh,1,"Reached out via WhatsApp and was greeted by Muhd.
Was disgusted by the support team as the response is nothing but dodgey. I’ve requested for the subscription fees but was instead asked a series of questions in returned like my training goals, work location and my education background. Eventually was asked to visit the store physically for more information (which I declined) and yes, my only question is not at all answered.

Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,Irish,1,"The gym itself is excellent — clean, well-equipped, and convenient — but I found the membership cancellation process to be quite different from other Anytime Fitness locations.

From what I understood, and after checking with friends and staff at other branches, cancellations typically only require a written one-month notice (for example, by text message). At this branch, however, I was told that I needed to book an in-person appointment to cancel. The earliest available appointment was about two weeks later, which meant my notice period overlapped into the next billing cycle. As a result, I ended up paying for two months instead of one.

I also stopped by during staffed hours to see if the cancellation could be handled sooner, but the staff explained that it could only be processed at a scheduled appointment unless there was an exceptional reason. When my appointment finally came, the process itself took just a few minutes and did not even require a signature, which left me wondering why it couldn’t have been completed earlier.

Overall, I really enjoyed training at this gym and had planned to return in the future once my other membership ended. However, the cancellation process was disappointing, so I would encourage prospective members to confirm the exact cancellation procedure with this branch before signing up or changing your home gym, to avoid any unexpected charges.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2sxNFlXcDZiVVUyY2tWWVJtWXlPWFJYU0VoRlNGRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,I. Ong,3,First visit to this new gym on a weekend and it was quite quiet. Maybe becos it’s still new. Do note that there are limited equipments available as it is a very small gym. But I do like that there is a skier machine. Two shower cubicles are quite tiny too. It will be good if the gym can provide paper towels at the toilet basin area. WC is located outside which makes it inconvenient. The aircon is also kinda weak. Will think twice before visiting as I’m not sure if it will be too crowded during peak hours on weekdays.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNianIzZU1BEAE
Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,Isaac Kiat,3,"Gym is new and small; there is 1 smith machine and 1 power rack. There is 2 multi gym machines.
2 shower rooms available and 1 wash basin. There are dumbbell rack and benches. From 1 end of the gym can view to the other end.

The duty staff looked unapproachable and stern today.

It's a good gym for fast and short machine workout.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIdnBtNnNRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,Carla,1,"It was my first time visiting this branch, and it was quite tricky to find. The outlet is small and has an unpleasant smell, likely because there is no toilet inside—only two small shower cubicles. I assume people use the shower facility to pee instead of going to the next office building to use the toilet. Additionally, using the Evolt 360 machine here costs $25, whereas it is free at other outlets like CCP.
This gym is convenient for those office areas in the same bldg.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJLWFDRHFRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,Muhammad Noor Hakim Azman,2,"This gym meets the bare minimum requirements. There’s no toilet on site, and the air conditioning after hours is only functional on one side, which can make it uncomfortable. The equipment is serviceable but nothing exceptional. It seems more suited for those working nearby who need a quick workout rather than a full-fledged fitness experience.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIaVAtRUpnEAE

Anytime Fitness Tampines Grande,NTCS Capital,1,"They have an Indian club manager.. he is very rude and arrogant. He is also very irresponsive.. a simple query can take him 2 to 3 days just to reply. When I politely asked for an invoice urgently, he took one day to reply and said he could only send me via WhatsApp and not email. But he didn’t. And then he demanded for my photo cuz apparently my profile was incomplete (?).

He went on to say he didn’t have to send me the invoice, cause I’m not entitled to it. He said they are also a non GST registered company and didn’t have to give invoices; and that he was just merely doing me a favour. After that he also accused me of being rude when I tried to chase for the invoice after 2 days, then he simply refused to give it. He abruptly called me during the day when I was at work and I did not pick up. And then he went on to lecture me about how to show him respect first.

It’s the same management for bishan branch also, so best to avoid both Tampines Grande and Bishan outlets. I have spoken to some other customers who also said that they were very irresponsive and not helpful at all.

They are also in dispute with another outlet over some client issues, and they have been very difficult too. Apart from that, the gym is also very small and there are no showers available. Their social media was last updated about 2 months ago when they opened.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNudVpHa2NnEAE
