Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,Mervyn Koh,1,"Have been with Anytime Fitness for almost 6 yrs now have been here a couple of times. Like thr gym model that allows us to go to various branches at our convenience. Was always a nice quiet space that did their workouts despite the smallish space and lack of facilities like locker spaces. Water point is an on and off thing with it not functioning at times.

What's concerning is of late, is their trainers have started some sort of racial profiling. Chinese members have been subjected to multiple checks, and despite them having valid key fobs, have been asked all sots of queries which mildy borders on racial discrimnation. This also disrupts the workout is quite off putting. This is by far the only branch that Ive seen do this.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xOSFpWaEdlWFZGYkcxUGQzQnROVXQwYkhoaExYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,Jay See,5,"I was scouting out the neighborhood yesterday before moving in to my new home nearby. Being an existing member but I didn't have my key fob with me, I was trying to peek in from the small entrance door when Ammirul came out to warmly invite me inside. He has such a friendly and passionate demeanor that instantly makes me drawn to this place. I'm looking forward to start working out here and making this my new home club in the future!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pOa00weGpSRk5JVFdZemNFTTRTak4xZVU5RU9YYxAB
Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,Han Chia Bih,5,"I love this gym at Kebun Baru. I have just moved into this area and was encouraged to sign up. I am glad I did. From the rest of the regular gym goer here, they told me we are on one of the better managed gym. Here, the staff make efforts to receive feedbacks, are proactive, friendly and helpful. I give credit to the manager Shahrul. I have watched and observed him at work…talking to members and patiently coaching his staffs. I am a retiree who have worked many years in the luxury retail industry…if I am still in that corporate world I would definitely poached this manager hahaha to join my ex-company. I am writing this review in hope that Any Fitness is aware they are so lucky to have such a diligent employee managing this space. Pls keep Shahrul at this Kebun Baru outlet. LOL.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21WMU4wVTFMWFZvYURadWFWUkxPRlZZUTNGRmFsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,Audrey Lee,1,"DO NOT GO TO THIS GYM.

This club has zero professionalism and no respect for loyal paying members.

One of the trainers stole my camera stand, and instead of taking real action, the management simply gave him a scolding—no repercussions. No accountability. No apology.

I’ve been paying monthly dues and training here nearly every day for almost a year. Last month, my father got into a serious accident in Malaysia. I was under a lot of stress and had to renew my membership through another branch. On May 26, I entered the gym during that transition period. I don’t remember if I tapped my fob or not—but instead of a conversation, a warning, or any human decency… they just blocked me.

So let me get this straight:
•A trainer steals from a member = slap on the wrist.
•A member possibly forgets to scan their fob during a family emergency = banned.

When I called to discuss this, the manager Sharul called me “entitled.” That’s the kind of energy this club operates with.

This was the most unprofessional, disrespectful treatment I’ve ever experienced from a business. If you care about safety, respect, and human decency—go elsewhere.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tzdGFHSnlSMjlKVjFkUFduazNRV0Z3TXpoU2NIYxAB
Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,James Tong,3,"I use this gym a couple of weeks every year when I visit Singapore because it's close to where I stay.

While extremely small, I always go in the morning when there's less people, so I've had no trouble getting my workout done.

The dumbbell weight rack is small, fitting only three benches in front of the mirrors.  One cable machine.  Everything is in close proximity to each other. No bicep or tricep machine, no hack squat.

Okay gym.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VLaTN0OW1SM2F2UzRnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,Will Ng,5,"I visited during a free trial and while the gym could use a Hack Squat and a Seated Leg Curl to be fully equipped, the experience was elevated by Ammirul's excellent service. His friendly and helpful nature more than compensated for the missing equipment. Definitely 5 stars, thanks to Ammirul!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBLWE3aHZnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,b lii,5,"Anytime Fitness (Kebun Baru CC) is a great gym. Here are the mixture of reasons:
1. Gym equipment suit the needs of everyone.
2. Once in a while, I notice the gym staff makes small changes to the placement of the equipment, to improve the gym layout. They are always thinking of new ways to give a better gym environment! These are small changes that the gym users may not even notice.
3. Helpful team/staff, no matter past or current staff. The friendly team is always there to help. At the same time, they balance it very well too; they will just leave the gym users to enjoy their own workout, but when users need their advice, they will help.
4. The gym users-- The gym users mind their own business, and don't go around trying to chat with strangers, or trying to give unwanted advice. This is unlike most other gyms. They just stay in their own zone. And many of them wipe the gym equipment after use, with sanitizer+cloth (This is not a strict rule). I hope that future members are like this too.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5bFltVmhBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kebun Baru CC,YS Lim,5,"It's a bit small but it has most of the equipment one needs. Equipment is quite new. The location is fantastic. It is near a bus stop as well as close to Mayflower station. Friendly crowd. While there are changing and showering rooms, you would need to go out to the community centre toilets to do your other businesses or wash your hands. Not a big problem.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudU91LTVBRRAB
