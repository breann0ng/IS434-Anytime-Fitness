Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Shi Xuan Teng,1,"Manager of the branch is rude and unprofessional and keep claiming that she is professional. I had an escalation with their staff with regards to cancellation and they said will escalate to their manager. However after 2.5 weeks I reached out again to them they said I had already escalated but however there's no return call from the manager till I nudge them again.

However 'professional' they claimed to be; it just seems like they are not helping members to get the necessary done.. manager keep reinforcing that its stated clearly in the contract.. like duh.. i know it is in the contract.. but if that so IMPORTANT.. you could had directed your members to that clause at the point of sign up and not telling members that your contract stated so when they tries to terminate.

Staff isn't any better; no push no work, very difficult.. think twice before you sign up with AF. Never had any issues with other gyms.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21ocWVVWTJVRGRYZVZKVk5VUkhWVEJYVUdGamFrRRAB

Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Spartan Dan,4,"Quite a small gym. But sufficient for my needs. 2 half rack, one smith, dumbbell racks and machines.
Sadly no deadlift platform.. and no toilet inside. Need to walk abit to go toilet and change up.
Free weights corner also quite cramp.
People need to squeeze through. But overall equipment all top notch and new. Nice. Place",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqMlBmT1d3EAE
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,A M,5,"Very cozy and super clean gym. Gym equipment is new. Has sufficient space to do workouts and run with friends.

Currently gymming during CNY, so the gym is relatively empty. Place has no toilet nor drinking fountain inside gym, so everything needs to be done outside gym.

Overall 5 stars!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkOEs3cmZBEAE
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,gghoulish,5,"Very nice facility, with a fair anount of equipments, and conveniently located in a small plaza.

It reminds me of my home club at Tengah.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT205U2NYWlZNMEo2VkdobVFVOHpPREZsTTNGd2NXYxAB
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Lam Ahmad,5,Amazing Service by Tahseen herself. She really explained in detailed and giving her best her task and ensure we are well understand in what we are signing up for the packages...,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJdmRIMDVBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,B Chin,1,"I had a very disappointing experience at this gym. First of all, the space is extremely small and overcrowded. Even after their recent expansion, it’s still cramped, and you constantly feel like you’re going to bump into someone or get hit by equipment. It’s not a comfortable or safe environment to work out in.

Another major issue is the lack of gym machines. There are far too few for the number of people using the gym, and they’re always occupied. You end up wasting so much time waiting around, which makes it impossible to stick to a workout routine.

The staff is also incredibly unhelpful. While I knew about the free month promotion, they never informed me when it was available to redeem. It felt like they were intentionally keeping it vague to avoid giving members the benefit. And when I finally redeemed it, I was hit with another issue—they wouldn’t let me cancel my membership immediately after the free month ended. Instead, I was forced to wait until the membership period was over, which meant they charged me for an additional month I didn’t want.

Overall, this gym feels more like a money grab than a place that cares about its members. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBM2UtRXFRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Su,5,"I'm incredibly thankful to Tahseen for her responsiveness and for helping me with the termination process, even though I'm from a different outlet. Terminations are time-sensitive, and I was really frustrated when my home gym team was not responding at all. It got to the point where I seriously considered never returning to Anytime Fitness.

But the moment Tahseen stepped in, everything changed. She was prompt, clear, and genuinely kind — she didn’t have to help, but she did, and she did it so professionally. It reminded me that there are still team members like her in this network who care and go the extra mile. Her support turned what could’ve been a very negative experience into one that left me feeling heard and respected.

Thank you Tahseen, for leaving such a positive impression. AF is lucky to have you and as long as there are team members like you around, I would want to return to AF.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VNU2dob1dmNXBxMzVRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Lawrence Lim,3,"It had been a good journey with AF Sunshine Place. As the gym is small, the place is getting more and more crowd. Sometimes I walk in and walk out the next minute.

The missing stars. A disappointment when my membership was turned inactive one day before my contract ended. Later it was clarified as a “technical glitch” and I could visit on the last day during manned hours. What a joke!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBNXRLUnl3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,evan,5,"Anytime Fitness is an amazing gym with a welcoming atmosphere and great equipment. A special shoutout to Bella, whose positive energy and support make every visit a joy. She’s always helpful, friendly, and truly cares about the members. Highly recommend!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2bzk2MVhnEAE
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Muhammad,5,"Extremely fun workout program for beginners conducted by Marissa. She teaches both the correct form and also how to use the gym equipments. Definitely a no-pressure, beginner friendly program.

Gym is unfortunately on the smaller side, with no shower facilities. Equipments and facilities are clean and fully functioning, just currently the space is cramped. But they are expanding the gym this year, so this is probably a temporary issue that will be resolved soon.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3dWQ3VlJnEAE

Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,Ke Sheng Loo,1,"Disappointed as a 3-years member. Was told that I have to follow the In-house rule to serve another month of notice after member termination notice which I was not informed in the first place. Branch manager could not retrieve the contract I signed, didn’t try to work around any other alternatives and told me off to made my last payment even i will not be able to utilise the gym anymore due to relocation reason.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYdWFPQTBRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Sunshine Place,CheeKeong Leow,5,"As a dedicated kettlebell enthusiast, I was thoroughly impressed by the gym's facilities. The spacious layout provides plenty of room to perform a wide range of kettlebell exercises without feeling cramped or restricted. Whether you're into swings, cleans, presses, or Turkish get-ups, the open floor plan ensures you can move freely and safely.

What truly sets this gym apart is its diverse selection of kettlebells. They offer a comprehensive range of weights, catering to beginners just starting out and experienced lifters seeking a more challenging workout. The equipment is well-maintained, ensuring a comfortable grip and consistent performance during workouts.

For anyone passionate about kettlebell training, this gym delivers the perfect environment to hone your skills, build strength, and achieve your fitness goals. I highly recommend it for both seasoned lifters and those looking to explore the versatility of kettlebell workouts!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfemFhWi1nRRAB
