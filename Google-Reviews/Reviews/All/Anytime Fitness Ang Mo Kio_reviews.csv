Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,K,1,"It was such an unpleasant service I had encountered at the  AMK outlet. The experience was unwelcoming, and the manager demonstrated a lack of understanding and responsiveness, prioritizing profit over customer care.

I encountered issues with my last payment, which mirrored a problem I faced with my initial payment at a different location. While the previous outlet addressed the situation effectively, the manager at the AMK outlet directed me to contact the third-party payment provider and my bank for assistance. Ultimately, I was informed that a resolution was contingent upon her decision to waive the extra fee.

It was evident that she was disinclined to assist. The only possible way for a waiver was to maintain my membership, despite expressing my intention to continue only when a promotion becomes available.

I would advise potential customers to be aware of Mrs Sharon tactics.

There have been similar experiences that other members have expressed with her as well.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuOE9hY2VREAE

Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Karen Chua,5,"I went to the recently renovated AMK branch.  There seemed to be more machines and most looked newer compared to the previous batch.  But I think only some machines were replaced.  Overall, machines and equipment were in good condition and work very well for members.
The toilet also has a new look.  However, I would like to feedback that where there used to be separate Ladies and Gents are now unisex WC and shower cubicles lest for one female-only WC.  The space is now common to any one in any gender or orientation.  While im ok with Unisex cubicles, I still appreciate a female-only space for me to wash up after a workout.  With this new arrangement,  it will deter many members, like myself, from using the showering facilities.  Is this common in other AF branches?  I will check out other branches.  Overall, im not so thrilled with the new toilet re-design.

8 Oct 2024
Thank you for the response.  Besides the toilet, Sharon has been very friendly and member-centric, always keen to ensure members’s needs are met. Thank you Sharon!

Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Ryan Lim,5,"I am a beginner and just signed up as a member for this gym. Few days back I was trying to do deadlifts, but did not realize that my form was off. After my first set, I could feel my back straining but did not think much as I thought it was a sign of a good workout. Thankfully, a kind and friendly staff (Theo) came up to me while I was resting in between my set and told me it was his first time seeing me at that gym, and asked if I was new to lifting. I said yes shyly and instead of ending the conversation there, he carried on to politely tell me that I was doing the deadlift wrong, and taught me the proper technique on the spot with lesser weights. I could immediately feel the difference and after the set I did not feel my back tense up as much as before, so Theo might have actually saved me from potential injury there! I hope every gym has attentive and supportive staff like this, will definitely ask my friends to start gymming here too.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuX1pEbGJnEAE

Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Kz (Khai's story),1,The music selection at this gym could really use more variety. It's so.. Gay. There’s an excessive amount of K-pop—especially BTS—which doesn’t suit everyone’s taste and can make the workout environment feel depressing. I’d honestly prefer silence over hearing Kpop constantly.

2. Alot of rusty and not well maintained equipment.

I urge everyone to take a look at the reviews before joining. i only joined because it is near to my place, but u will be shocked at how poorly maintained everything is, apparently due to it being the ""one of the oldest branch in sg"" but it doesnt excuse anything. Everytime i touch a weight plate or barbell i will have a rust stain on my palm. How do you expect people to enjoy their workouts when your staff are condescending, and the equipment are so old?
Not worth buying membership at, only good if u like to be covered in rust and be treated poorly by staff",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPb2F6V2NBEAE

Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Jon Sanchez,2,"Signing up is a breeze, management is fine. Automatic payment also no issues. Very spacious space and variety of equipment that can target all muscle groups. Not allowed to park my bicycle inside during staff hours but at night everyone else does it.
There is a large group of youngsters who workout in this gym who are quite friendly but extremely loud and completely disregard social distancing and roam around with masks. It almost becomes like a community gym which is not what we pay for. They love to slam their weights like they own the whole gym. They will chope benches with handphones or water bottles but will do something else that doesn’t even require a bench. You can ask nicely tho but common courtesy would be nice. Good if you’re part of their circle but a nuisance if you’re not.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXbHZ2TUdBEAE
Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Edward Nathan,1,"To whom it may concern,

This poor review is a reflection of the poor management of the gym despite its good location and relatively good range of equipment! I have been  member of many gyms in my lifetime, and this is one of the worst managed.

My main grouses:
1. Currently not open at convenient times for the majority of the working members; opening times are from 9 or 10 in the mornings even for weekends, which is not convenient. Despite most Anytime Fitness gyms being touted as 24-hours or even 18-hours to allow for cleaning. The main reason for joining such a gym is the flexibility of hours it affords to members
2. Poor maintenance of the equipment - free weights are poorly maintained and rusty, repaired with duct tape. Most of the cardio machines do not even work.
3. Poor level of hygiene especially in these times.
4. Poor ventilation - most of the air-con units are not working and the gym can be sweltering especially when temperatures are warm.  There is no proper ventilation/ venting of premises.
5. The management allows unvaccinated members in to train, and has a mask on at all times policy, which goes against recommendations by the government. As many of the members belong to the older generation, it puts them at risk even if they are vaccinated. I myself fall into this age group, so am very reluctant to continue.

To any member of the public hoping to join a gym, my advice is to look elsewhere to other gyms in the area as there are other options, especially is safety and health is your main consideration for joint a gym.

To the management- I hope that things will improve soon. Am very disappointed with the state of affairs. Please do  a better management job or else many of the older members will reconsider other options. We are not asking for the best equipment nor the most modern/up-to-date machines. In these times, proper management is essential to the long-term commitment of members or even potential members.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2a0k2cWRnEAE
Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Melvin Pao,5,"Clean and friendly gym for anyone looking to get fit. The gym is fairly well-equipped.

Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Adrienne Lee,5,"I've been working out at AF AMK for the last 5 years and it had always been a very warm and welcoming experience for me. Contrary to the experience that 'poor management' had. The club had really done their utmost in ensuring a safe environment for users and members since the reopening in phrase 2. Ample sanitizers were placed and safe distancing measures were taken very seriously to ensure the safety of the members. I've encountered a certain recalcitrant who repeatedly and blatantly refused to use towel in the gym and insist on talking loudly with other members who are working out, oblivious to the government's advise that talking loudly increases the risk of spreading the virus. The staff had really been very patient in advising the rule flouter again and again, I'm sure other places would have kicked him out of the premise after 3 warnings. We are really looking forward to working out in a safe environment and the staff are doing an excellent job in ensuring that this privilege of physical visits to gyms are not taken away due to some inconsiderate, self entitled individual.

Poor management. This gym allows both vaccinated and unvaccinated gym members, which means the mask must be on at all times. However, I was dismayed that when I went on 31/10 noon, the users were not wearing, and the staff was wearing slippers while gymming and mingling with a group of members. How many SMM rules has he violated?

Poor facilities. The male toilet has no privacy, they left the toilet door ajar and has no bathing facilities.

Anytime Fitness Ang Mo Kio,Jamal Tan,1,"RECONSIDER others (seriously) before signing up for this one.

I signed up in the middle of 2020 and here is my experience thus far:

1: If you may need to leave the country, definitely stay away from this institution and the branch, for example EP cancellation. They give a verbal and WhatsApp commitment that if you leave you will not be charged a fee but they still charge it. Later, they play with ignorance and say you misunderstood our communication. If you are not a citizen or PR stay away. Filing a claim in statecourts.gov.sg for this. I say this with all honesty that it is not about the money they charge but it is the dishonesty that I cannot tolerate.

2: Cleanliness: They were good at first but later became sloppy.One of the worst was not having cleaning wipes around for close to two months. I had to reduce my visits during those times. I remember reading their answer here in one review that it was due to the supplier issue but I was told another reason for that. They provided spray and a small SAME towel to reuse for wiping others sweat, during this pandemic time.Really!!

3: You cannot cancel your membership if it is during CircuitBreaker. Yet, they will still charge you cancellation fee and they force you to stay the duration of your monthly membership fee after the circuit breaker. Again, filing a claim in statecourts.gov.sg for this. This is the most strange and unfair business practice I have ever heard of it. Your cancellation notice day is forced-pushed to after Circuit breaker.

4: The device outside to check your temperature to unlock the entrance is another buggy item. Most of the time the door will not open.  I saw many suffer with the same problem.

5, 6, 7: I will be posting more about my experience here in a month.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNhay1tYWpBRRAB
