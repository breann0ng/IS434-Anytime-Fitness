Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Ben Kang,5,"My home gym is Anytime Fitness Kovan (JForte). But today, I decided to venture to Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon. Zero regrets. This gym has the legendary Hammer Strength Plate Loaded Glute Drive machine. This S Tier machine alone makes me give a 5 star rating.

Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon > Anytime Fitness Kovan / Anytime Fitness Nex.

I’m writing this review out of my own volition: I was in the gym super early, so no chance to get the freebies.

Pros:
- Clean, well-maintained, efficient, high-quality equipment.
- Excellent music selection, not too loud. The music is on the chill end, which is perfect for the breaks between intense sets. During the sets, you can use your own earphones to play your favourite lifting songs.
- Water cooler is right next to the sink.

Possible improvements (I will transfer my membership + immediately sign my parents, relatives, friends here if they have these):
- Replace Lying Leg Curl -> Hammer Strength Select Seated Leg Curl (with thigh pads, NOT the Precor one with shin pads). Something about better stretch mediated hypertrophy. For hardcore people who still want to target the Biceps Femoris Short Head more, they can hop to the nearby iGym for their Lying Leg Curl.
- Hammer Strength Select Hip Abduction. Not a deal breaker, but great to have, cuz the nearby iGym has a Hip Abduction machine too.
- More 20kg plates on the Hammer Strength Plate Loaded Glute Drive. Cuz this is one of the few exercises which can be overloaded a lot. Having more 20kg plates here means less need to grab from the leg press and other places.
- Dedicated Bulgarian Split Squats support (short adjustable stand with the roller pad for the back leg). This won’t occupy much space.

Anyways, having the Hammer Strength Plate Loaded Glute Drive machine makes it worth the walk from Kovan MRT to Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon, instead of the Anytime Fitness Kovan. This gym is small, but it has the Hammer Strength stuff. Hammer Strength is like the Ferrari of gym equipment.

Pro tip: the 24Hr An-Nur makmak beside it sells really clean food. Plain rice + Sambal fish + Egg. ;)

To Anytime Fitness Kovan (if you are even reading this), I am personally willing to fund these machines to make you on-par with Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon (so I don’t need to walk that much). I’m the person who replenished the barbell hip thrust pads btw. You have so much gym real estate, so much potential, don’t waste it.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t0NGVIbHlWM1ZIVDJaNVFuUnVVM0J2VFV0dlFYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Alice Zation,5,"Connivence: Can go by Serangoon MRT or Kovan. But need to take bus!

Washroom: its located outside the gym but really clean. Shower rooms are inside the gym.

Photo taking: Outside the showers have a nice place. Mirror at weights also! Lighting is yellowish so its cool~

Space: its homely vibes~

Leg Day: great for squat days cause there is 4 of it.

Back Day: superb for it. Lots of machine suited for it.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pJd05WQTBjMVJIYUhkck1WaEJVSEEyWmtSWWMwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Roger Thomas Tan,5,"Gym is great! Equipments are new, free weights are new! Cosy but the members are few so you can just use whatever station you like - good for those who find it easier not to share or wait for stations! The bathroom is awesomely great too! Nicely fitted shower head! Their mirror outside the bathroom makes you look bigger than you really are - great for guys wanting to train and look big! The music they play are reggae, acid jazz and lounge! Really sensually classy! Unlike some other gyms which like to blast techno! They have tons of things like zero calories salad dressing, bbq sauce, jam! Plus even have details on getting affordable steamed chicken breast for healthy eating! So you see people running this gym is serious abt getting fit and trimming fats! Great job to the manager Eugene! Just nite that the toilet is outside at the back- you need to bring your token with you if you want to get back. Parking is at the back near the private estate. Or you can park at Upper Serangoon shopping Center and take a nice stroll over. Once again great job guys! I love this gym! Thanks for all the effort Manager Eugene! Guys you need to use this gym if you are in Kovan area! It’s simply great!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURULWZUcWZ3EAE
Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Hao Jun Chua,5,"New and spacious gym. Brightly lit and clean.

Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Kai Keat Lim,5,i walk 1.6km to this gym 5 days a week even though nex is nearer just because its that good. good equipment and the place is clean. would still give 5 stars even if i wasn't bribed with banana and 100 plus zero.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25rNVN6aHBPVTEzWkhkbU0zbE1iRGh3TjNVd09XYxAB
Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Feng Yi Chew,5,"Newly-opened gym located in between the Serangoon and Kovan MRT stations.

Outfitted with Hammer Strength and Life Fitness equipment (the best IMO), with more plate-loaded machines on the way as of late-April 2024. Love the enormous variety of grip attachments for back training, and the broad array of cardio machines (which even includes a ski erg and curved treadmill).

Staff are friendly and approachable, and also very diligent in keeping the place tidy and clean, which I appreciate very much!

Toilets are located outside in the main building, but there are showers, changing rooms, lockers, and cubby holes in the gym itself.

A great addition to the Upper Serangoon neighbourhood! 💪",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqN19EZzl3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Lord Len,5,"The staffs are friendly and very attentive. I had one of my bag straps stuck in the door of the locker underneath mine and because I was in a hurry to leave, the gym manager Anna had to locate the person and someone eventually unlocks his locker to free my bag haha! Another time, I left my phone and she patiently waited for me when she could just go home. Thank you for the personal touches and very sorry! Overall, the place may be small but I like this gym as it’s clean and the machines sufficient to meet my needs. My gf appreciates the hip thrust machine as it’s not found at our former home club. There are charging points, and sanitizers/towel dispensers conveniently located around the gym to clean the seats.

The gym crew is highly responsive and flexible with communication over whatsapp. Solid.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VMeXVqNHkzNU5YRVVBEAE

Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Nicholas Lee wei liang,4,"Lovely open concept gym, i love how spacious it is. Did a chest session here! One thing i noticed is that this gym is lacking quite a few machines and it definitely has the space for more equipment. Changing rooms and mirrors 10/10! Would suggest to the owners to remove the fans as they blow directly on to most areas of the compound and makes it almost impossible to keep my body temp up. Also the air con is full blasting directly on the chest flys machine and other machines. Waayyyy too cold and this is coming from a fatty 🤣 Overall i love the vibes and look forward to seeing more new EQ!

Anytime Fitness Upper Serangoon,Jacynda Teo,5,"I’m thrilled with my experience at the AF Upper Serangoon branch! The gym is incredibly cozy and feels relatively brand new, which was a big factor in my decision to sign up with AF. The modern and clean environment makes working out a pleasure.

One minor downside is that the toilet is located outside the gym. However, this actually contributes to a cleaner and more organized changing room area, which is a nice trade-off. The overall neatness of the facility is definitely a plus.

The layout of the machines is well-planned, making the workout space both functional and efficient. It’s clear that a lot of thought went into the design to ensure a great user experience.

Overall, I’m very satisfied with this location and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch gym experience!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURINElINUt3EAE
