Anytime Fitness Orchard,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,5,"The location is quite convenient especially if you're those who like to workout during the weekend and go shopping/eating out at town after. The staff is friendly. Plenty of machine varieties suitable for bodybuilding or powerlifting. The free weights area might be a bit cramped, but thank God the squat racks/lifting platforms are not. The changing rooms are well-equipped with toiletries.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VQS1Y2X1RfNE1xMGVnEAE
Anytime Fitness Orchard,Naveen Vasudevan,5,"AF Orchard is conveniently located near public transport and surrounded by plenty of restaurants, making it easy to fit workouts into a busy schedule. The gym is well-equipped with properly maintained machines and clean, modern facilities including toilets and lockers. Experienced trainers are always on hand to offer guidance and support. Equipment is handled with care, and the overall environment is safe and welcoming. The support staffs are welcoming and approachable.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJejZDenFRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Orchard,chat noir wow,5,"Update 6 April: I’m so glad that they managed to get the air con back for the cardio area. It is now so comforting to run at AF orchard, no other AFs have such pleasant air con for running. It keeps the humidity low and easier for breathing.

I've been coming to AF Orchard for runs on treadmill. The air con used to be good for 10km runs. However, the staff mentioned that the reason for the weak air con at the cardio area is run by the management. While there are fans, but the air remain hot and humid at the treadmills area. I have also observed other runners checking out which treadmill has better ventilation. But they are mostly similar in terms of temperature and ventilation. Otherwise, the staff are great! I once forgot my hair band and the staff gave me hers. ❤️ The space is perfect, not claustrophobic. If the air con temperature could be cooler, this will be the best gym I visited among AF. They also have members treat!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJdnJtMHdBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Ahmad Taufiq Muhammad,4,"Came to the gym a few time due to its convenience in town for a quick training session in  the early morning or during lunch.

Positives
- Convenient, easy parking and smack in the middle of town
- Equipment pretty standard

Some negatives
- toilets need a bit of sprucing up, mold on the wall and the fibreglass ceiling is coming apart.
- Can get quite crowded",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VObm56b2llOEkyOUt3EAE
Anytime Fitness Orchard,Jeremy Chan,5,"My 1st time coming to this AF gym & I must say, definitely not disappointed. All the AF gyms that are pretty much central; city area; have proven to be more than adequate for a fruitful workout. They have all the necessary equipment required for a great work out.

Top 3 AF gyms for me in Singapore are pretty much all in the main city, lol. City Hall, Wheelock, & this Orchard Gateway/313 outlet. This definitely won’t be the last time I hit this gym. I’m just glad my 3 favorite AF gyms are all close to where I reside.

5 outta 5 stars for this gym as well!

P.S. This gym & the Wheelock branch have nice views, this one more right smack on Orchard though hahaha.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6aktIQkRBEAE
Anytime Fitness Orchard,Lucien Lim,4,"A great branch of AF that has an excellent location and friendly staff! It is clean and well maintained, and has most of the equipment one would need.

The only downside to this gym is also it’s plus, that being it’s good location. Situated on the 4th floor of Orchard Gateway, it’s a convenient 5 min walk from Somerset MRT, making it busy/crowded even at 11pm. This can be an issue as one would have to wait a while to use the equipment.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQta28tRnV3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Orchard,K T,2,"me and my friend took the empty hip thrust machine (no weights on it) and a PT came up to us and said he was using it for his client, this just seems like he is using his power to get us to leave the machine so he can use for his client... so rude that he lied and cannot just be frank about wanting to use, if he asked nicely instead of saying oh im using this, we would not have felt angry",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2toYVQwcFVkazVFVUhFMVZqVjROSFF5UjJsMGJWRRAB

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Munny L,4,"Located on level 4 after the concierge on the right, in Orchard Central.

One of the best anytime fitness gym experiences, ample of workout equipment, 2 squat racks!

Great view overlooking orchard road (not pictured) and Dyson hairdryers at the shower rooms. Lots of lockers for you to pick from! Finally can workout in orchard central.

About 20-25 pax on a Saturday,  lunchtime workout.

Open 24/7! Staff hours are till 10pm daily.

Missing a shaker or forgot a tee? Anytime has got your back with 5 colours to choose from, I had to refrain from buying too many shakers.

I think it just lacked the vending machine with the protein shakes though, it's more convenient!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXNnN5TVpBEAE
Anytime Fitness Orchard,Sihan Goi,4,"Pretty good gym with ample strength equipment even though it's not very big (2 platforms, 2 power racks, 1 half rack, 6 regular Olympic bars, other assorted bars, bumper plates). The gym advertised Eleiko bars but apparently it's only during manned hours (I saw staff taking 2 of them out slightly before 9am), and they are PL bars (was hoping for WL bars). Out of the 6 regular bars, only 1 spins well.

Despite the equipment, there were multiple signs prohibiting slamming of weights, even with bumpers and platforms, so I don't think management would take kindly to weightlifting. Machines are placed very near one another too, and the warmup/stretching area is tiny, and also no studio for classes. Lastly, there's a Life Fitness kinetic rower which I thought was a really dumb idea, because in order to even turn the rower on, you have to keep pulling it (apparently it runs off the kinetic energy generated from pulling). I had the rower die on me twice while trying to just set up a session, and before I even started my session I must've rowed  a few dozen times. The resistance is also adjusted by a knob that goes clockwise or anticlockwise, but doesn't show you what resistance it's currently at so there's no way of knowing. Why so many AF outlets get all sorts of weird indoor rowers instead of just getting C2 rowers, I'll never know...

There are showers but no sink or toilets, so if you need to wash your hands or use the toilet, you'll have to walk 2 min to the toilet outside.
Crowd wise, I was surprised to see the racks all being used at 7am, but they were free by the time I was done with warmup. Strangely, most of the free weights were being used by ladies rather than men. While that was a welcome sight, c'mon men, we can do better.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dk1hNmtRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Farhan Lim,5,"My first time coming to this Anytime Fitness branch earlier today, no crowd, maybe bcuz its in the morning. The gym is super neat and clean. Good aircon and ventilation. AMAZING view while doing my warm up on the treadmill. I was mind blown to see a protein vending machine however alot of flavours sold out (i am sure it is a popular, high traffic gym in the evening), so i asked the staff Anwa if they were gonna top-up and have it available. Anwa was very nice and also explained to me how it works so bought one serving from the vending machine and we chatted for a bit. Seems like an amazing gym with fantastic location which is so convenient for some ppl cuz MRT is on B1! When i left the gym there was another staff who smiled and greeted her goodbye see you again to me! So comforting to see such warm service. I am coming here again tomorrow for sure!!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNObTg3ZUFnEAE

He’s consistently friendly and approachable, and it’s clear that he genuinely cares about the members. Whether it’s answering questions, helping with equipment, or just checking in, Aaqil is always patient and respectful.

What I appreciate most is that he creates a comfortable atmosphere in the gym. It makes a difference, especially on days when motivation is low. You know you’ll still feel supported and welcome.

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Elisabeth,1,"I’ve generally had a positive experience at this gym, but recently, mall management implemented a baffling new policy—turning off the air conditioning from 10:30 PM to 10:30 AM. This decision has significantly impacted the gym environment, making workouts not only uncomfortable but also unsafe.

With Singapore’s already high temperatures and humidity, the lack of proper ventilation leads to excessive sweating, making machines slippery and increasing the risk of injury. A gym should be a space that encourages people to push their limits safely, not one that discourages attendance due to poor conditions.

I urge management to reconsider this policy, as it negatively affects the gym experience and potentially endangers members. Maintaining a cool, well-ventilated workout space is not a luxury—it’s a necessity.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUN3cjQzNXR3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Sylvester,1,"In a city where the sweltering heat is already a formidable foe, one would expect a reputable gym like OC Anytime Fitness to provide a sanctuary of sorts – a cool, refreshing oasis where one can escape the oppressive temperatures and focus on their fitness journey. Alas, dear reader, this is not the case.

Upon entering the gym during morning hours, I was immediately struck by the stifling air, thick with the stench of sweat and stagnation. It's as if the very walls were exhaling a collective sigh of despair. The reason for this sauna-like atmosphere? The gym's steadfast agreement to only turn on the air conditioning that follows the building's designated schedule.

And don't even get me started on the staff's apparent lack of initiative to provide even the most basic form of ventilation. A simple opening of the door, carefully monitored to ensure security, would have gone a long way in alleviating the suffocating atmosphere. But no, that would require too much effort, and apparently, that's too much to ask.

To add insult to injury, OC Anytime Fitness sees no need to inform its members about this egregious situation through social media or any other means. It's as if they're will-fully ignoring the problem, hoping that their patrons will simply suffer in silence. This is a gym that seems more concerned with following arbitrary rules than with providing a decent, comfortable experience for its members.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJelBYSTRBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Descloud 86,1,"I’ve been a regular at AF Orchard but lately, the conditions have become unbearable. The mall has switched off the air conditioning, leaving the gym with no ventilation. The result? Stuffy, humid air, excessive condensation on the equipment, and an overall unpleasant workout environment.

The condensation makes machines and weights wet and slippery, which is not only frustrating but also a serious safety hazard. On top of that, with no airflow, body odor lingers in the gym, making the experience even worse. It’s nearly impossible to get through a workout comfortably.

A gym should provide a clean, safe, and comfortable environment for its members. Unfortunately, this gym is failing at all three. Until management fixes the air circulation and improves hygiene, I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUN3aXNHXzJBRRAB

If you like planting your feet or a secure bar grip while lifting, avoid this location between these hours.

Not only did she make the signup process smooth and efficient, but she also took the time to understand my fitness goals and offered valuable insights on how to achieve them.

Throughout my time at the gym, Dian consistently went above and beyond to ensure I felt comfortable and supported.

Aside from her exceptional professionalism, Dian's positive energy and friendly demeanor created a welcoming atmosphere that made every visit to the gym enjoyable. Her passion for fitness and genuine care for members like myself truly set her apart.

Overall, my experience at Anytime Fitness Orchard has been outstanding, largely thanks to Dian's outstanding service.

3) Nice ""vibes"", clean, well-lit, music not too loud
4) Very good variety of machines but that leads me to the negatives.

Negatives:
1) Too cramped. The space itself is not big, I visited while it wasn't crowded but yet I felt like the machines were all placed too closed together. Imagine peak hour, you'll surely come too close to others and bump into them.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaM0sySFJBEAE

The second I walked through the door I was greeted with a wide and warm smile from yuda, who walked me through the trial process, and after which even went out of his way to give me some tips on how to better some of my workout techniques. As I came for a trial, I had a lot of questions. He was calm, polite, and extremely service oriented. He most definitely assuaged all of my apprehensions and is probably the reason I signed up!

In my defense, I have been allowed goodwill access to the gym in the past multiple times and have been lulled into complacency, and was somehow never told that I would be thrown out/ denied access. In AFO’s defense, they are perfectly entitled to do so according to the T&C first paragraph. Nonetheless I felt shamed and dismayed and after escalating and appealing at length to the floor manager Farah, she allowed me a ten minute workout.
To be fair this was a single occurrence. Some staff are really warm and friendly while others are nonchalant. Fellow gym users are generally polite and respectful; I’ve had no bad interactions in the past one year. Gym gets awfully crowded but between 11-4 I almost always had my pick of machines.

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Heidi Yu,1,"Super crowded and you could easily hit or touch the gym-goer next to you while doing your gym moves. The place is way too small for a popular/central location like Orchard. It should be called Anytime Crowded. If you join be prepared to be able to use the gym during limited hours, maybe in the early mornings or during office hours. But the gym was crowded even at 5pm and fellow locals should still be at work (yet they said it’s crowded because it’s after office hours).

Sales’ services and attitude aren’t great and they tried to disclaim their responsibility for gym experience. They wouldn’t “give a nice experience” but they offered “a suggestion to help you have a more comfortable experience”.

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Yassy Chan,4,"Love the convenience of this place. A 24 hour gym in town makes it a favorite spot. If you go late at night, though, you need to know how to get to the gym, which is in the 4th floor. A lot of the usual passageways may be closed.

The only thing I would say is that sometimes the gym equipment and cleaning supplies aren't as well maintained. There was once the leg press was out for a week. The cleaning cloths and sprays sometimes don't work (wear and tear) and given it's 24-hour but the staff won't always be there, the weights and machine attachments can sometimes be just jumbled up.

Borderline dangerous, if they are not watching out on who's walking by. 3 small shower cubicle and it's unisex co-share, quite openly with a small little bench for changing shoes. Can't say much about privacy.

I was also lucky to find a great personal trainer in Herzy. A personal trainer is not only the one who guides and motivates you to give your best during a workout session, but he is the expert who should know the workings of the body, the bones and the muscles. Herzy is all of that and more. He fully understands your requirement and accordingly customises your workout to suit your current needs and future goals.

Anytime Fitness Orchard,In2rovert Life,5,"Pros
- Love the New Black Equipment
(Makes it feel High Class)
- Convenient location, just above Somerset MRT on the 4th floor of Orchard Central/Gateway (I get confused) with tons of post workout meal options below
- Mid sized, not gigantic but sufficient
- Has an inclined Leg Press to put on 200kg+

Cons
- Lacking in some machines, but only very specific ones like Tricep Seated station etc, besides that you're fine
- Can be crowded since its in the middle of Orchard (even at late night)
- No vending machine at my time of visit, but then again you got food options in the mall
- Didn't visit the showers or baths, unknown if they have them though.

I visit here once in a while if I'm passing by and on the way to work for a quick workout, but will stick to my usual locations for less people

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Freddy,1,"Second time in the gym and will never visit again. I was asked to leave bcoz I wear my KEEN shoes to do squat. The staff said it’s not “proper gym shoes” for workout. And it has never happened before for other anytime fitness branch I went to ( Kovan/ tanjong pagar etc). When I asked them if there’s any written rules or policy i can refer to, they cannot answer me and said it’s basic gym manner, and it will increase my “injury rate”.

The other 2 guys beside me were deadlifting with barefoot which I think it’s fine. And the staff asked them to wear their running shoes to do deadlift ! If ur reason is to reduce injury, I believe if u stand on running shoes and do deadlift will make ur injury rate higher….if the staff really know what’s weightlifting.

I asked the deadlift guy if he was told to wear shoes when deadlift in other gym, he also said never. He just joined this gym and felt very weird.

So other people wear converse/ vans are considered proper gym footwear ? I don’t know their logic.

Anytime Fitness Orchard,Lawrence L,4,"Room for improvement.
It’s a hassle to access the gym after midnight, visited on 13 Mar, 12:50AM (Sunday). Perhaps the lift should stop at the 4th floor?

Orchard Gateway finds it logical to limit lift movement to 5th & 1st floor when they have a 4th floor gym in operation 24hrs. Basically if you park your vehicle on 5th floor, you take the lift down to 1st floor before climbing up the escalator to the 4th floor to access the gym. Same way down and lift back up to 5th floor carpark. Good luck if you have bad knees.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXeEt6TjlnRRAB
