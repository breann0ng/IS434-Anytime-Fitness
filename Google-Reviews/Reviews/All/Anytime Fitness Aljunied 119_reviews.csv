Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Aaron Chua,5,"Just opened and already impressed!
Started training here right after the soft opening on the 23rd, and I’ve been really impressed so far. The facilities are brand new, clean, and well-designed for all types of workouts — from strength training to cardio. The equipment is top-of-the-line and there’s plenty of space even during peak hours.

The staff have been welcoming and professional. You can tell a lot of thought went into setting this place up. Looking forward to seeing how it grows, but so far it's been a great addition to the fitness community!

One of the places you'd really wanna gatekeep..

Highly recommend for anyone looking to join a fresh, modern, and well-equipped gym.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t0UWNsVTVhVVU1WkZObmJsbG1Wa1JzYkhORWQwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Shah Rez,5,"I recently joined AF Aljunied119, and I couldn’t be more impressed. As a brand-new facility, everything is spotless and state of the art from the cardio machines to the weight training area. The layout is spacious, modern, and well-organized, making workouts flow smoothly without feeling crowded.

What truly sets this gym apart is the staff. Everyone is incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable. During my first visit, Hamizan and Razzif showed me around and bring me on a club tour. You can tell they genuinely care about helping members succeed.

If you’re looking for a motivating environment to kick-start or level up your fitness journey, this place is absolutely worth checking out. Highly recommended!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VLN0YwSUxkNGFXMVJnEAE

Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Rachel Choo,1,"Very unpleasant experience. Similar to the other gym goers, I signed up on 18 feb 2025 on the condition that the gym would open in mar 2025 and that I was able to visit any outlets. Subsequently the outlet kept postponing its opening date and I couldn’t wait for it to open and told them to refund me. They did mention that I could visit the sister gym outlets but it was inconvenient for me. In the end, they transferred my membership to their sister gym outlet and i ended up paying the $98/mth membership price. Also recently realised that the outlet keyed in my email address wrongly!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tvNVFYSnBRaTF0ZDNaZlZ6Wk5aSFZsU1ZCa1lrRRAB

Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Tan JR,1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience - Constant Delays & No Communication

I strongly advise against signing up for a membership with AF Aljundied 119. I signed up based on the promise that the gym would open in February 2025, with the latest opening date being the end of March 2025.

It is now late April 2025, and the gym is still not open. What's worse is the complete lack of proactive communication from their side. Throughout this period, there have been absolutely no updates unless I reached out to them directly.

When I inquired about the delays, I was met with a series of excuses ranging from contractor issues to safety check delays, none of which came with a concrete, reliable new opening date. Now, they vaguely suggest a ""late April"" opening, but given the track record, I have very little confidence in this.

Their suggested ""solution"" of using sister gyms is impractical and inconvenient, requiring members to book appointments just to get a workout in – shifting the burden entirely onto the customer. They have shown zero accountability for the significant delays and the inconvenience caused to members who signed up in good faith based on their initial promises.

Despite failing to open on time and leaving existing members hanging, they are still actively advertising and signing up new people. This lack of transparency and disregard for customers who have already paid is unacceptable.

Save yourself the frustration and uncertainty. Look for other established gyms or new openings that value clear communication and actually deliver on their timelines. This has been a thoroughly disappointing experience, and I regret signing up.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvNHUzZFZREAE

Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,A,1,"Signed up in January when I saw the gym offering a pre-sale discount. The staff said the tentative opening date would be 18 Feb. Now it's end April and the gym is still not ready.

The management then decided to give access to only 4 gyms (which are all very far from where I live) during STAFFED HOURS. Why can't they just give us the keyfob that we have paid for? It already doesn't make sense that we have to pay for an access card on top of the membership fee when it is literally just an app to enter the gym.

Many other members also asked about the opening date and the gym's response was a mere copy paste talking about the safety issues, with no confirmed date. We can't even get a refund!

I would strongly advise against signing up at this gym. Save your money and sign at another outlet.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvb3ItTzRRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Xy Z,1,"I signed up before Chinese New Year, when they said they'd be opening around February or March. I only received one message in mid-February informing me of a delay, with a promise to update soon — but after that, there was radio silence until April.

I have to approach them to ask, all I heard were excuses about “safety issues” or “contractors.” I understand delays happen, but as the owner or management, that’s your responsibility, not something paying customers should be made to bear.

I requested to cancel my membership and get a refund due to the lack of service — but they refused to return any money. Extremely disappointing.

Would not recommend based on my experience.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJM3JPUWNREAE

Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Justin Tan,1,"Bad sales staff never even follow up for gym enquiries, mentioned to call back but did not. Was promised a $88 joining fee and when I came back tell me the offer expired and no service recovery was rendered",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VKcnN1YnZpX0t1bDdRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Felix R,1,"Don’t waste your money here. This whole experience feels like a complete scam. I signed up back in December when they told me the tentative opening date would be 18 Feb. Since then, it’s been one delay after another — pushed to late Feb/early March, then end March/early April. It’s now the end of April and there’s still ZERO updates on when (or if) this place is ever going to open.

Worse, the communication has been absolutely appalling. At first they said it’s due to delays on the contractor because of CNY. Then, when it’s past the promised 18 Feb opening date, they suddenly shifted the narrative to “safety issues.” When I asked via WhatsApp if this was a structural safety issue, they confirmed that it was — but refused to provide any further clarification.

What kind of safety issue are we even talking about here? Structural cracks? Load-bearing columns being hacked without a permit? Load bearing walls or structural beams hacked away without permit? These are serious concerns that any customer deserves to be informed about. But instead of transparency, they’re just dodging questions and hiding behind vague statements.

It’s honestly infuriating. They had time to update social media daily back in December and January to promote memberships and rake in pre-opening payments — but now they can’t even be bothered to give a simple, honest update about what’s going on? No proper announcements, no estimated dates, no transparency. Just the same useless copy-pasted replies that say absolutely nothing.

This whole situation is shady and completely unprofessional. At this point, I regret ever signing up. If you haven’t paid yet — don’t. And if you have, good luck getting any answers.

**update: they changed the opening date to May 2025 but still tbc 💀💀💀💀",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvdXRpS3JBRRAB

Reached out to them multiple times to get a confirmed start date which holds no truth. Staff was not the most professional and just copied and pasted a template message. No sincerity and transparency at all.

Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,Elise Tan,1,"The management would need to review its process in this regard. This gym is listed as open when it's still being renovated. Wasted my time travelling down. Plus, I also question why is there a 5 star review now when the gym isn't even open?",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfMHA2QjVBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Aljunied 119,J J,1,"I deeply regret signing up for a membership at Anytime Fitness (AF119) due to their complete lack of transparency and accountability. During registration, I was told the gym would open on 18 February 2025. However, I later learned that the opening was delayed to late February or early March—a minimum delay of 2-6 weeks. They then claimed the 18 February date provided during registration was always “tentative” and never confirmed.

When reviewing the membership agreement to check cancellation policies, I noticed the registration form I signed was missing a start date. When I asked the gym why this was omitted, they shifted the blame onto me for not clarifying the details. It is their responsibility to provide accurate and complete information during sign-up, yet they failed to do so.

What’s more, they now claim the membership contract wasn’t issued because the start date wasn’t confirmed. So, what exactly was the membership agreement I signed? Why weren’t customers informed that there is both a membership agreement and a separate membership contract? Can anyone verify the existence of this separate contract? Even if that’s the case, what was the purpose of signing the document if it doesn’t even count as a proper agreement? Charging customers without a confirmed start date or clear terms is not just misleading - it’s outright unethical.

When I requested a refund, I repeatedly asked for the full terms and conditions to justify their actions, but they refused. Instead, they blamed renovation delays. This is their business - why should the customer bear the consequences of their delays?

This entire experience may just be about a refund of $183, which I now realize I will likely never get back from a business with such unethical practices. However, I am sharing this because it is unacceptable for customers to be misled and blamed for the company’s lack of transparency and accountability. I want to warn others from being duped into this same situation.

If you’re considering joining this gym, proceed with extreme caution. Ensure every single detail is clarified in writing because transparency clearly isn’t a priority for them.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfcWZxdHp3RRAB
