The best part are the staffs, Zaf and Ziqri are super friendly, approachable, and always ready to help. They make the place feel welcoming and comfortable, whether you’re new to the gym or a regular.
Highly recommend this spot if you’re looking for a cozy gym with a personal touch and quality equipment! 💪",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pSemJIWkxTRzF3YTA1eWRITkhOVUZ2WjJsWk5FRRAB

Anytime Fitness Tampines 487,Hafiz Asman,5,Very unique underground bomb shelter AF under a HDB! Equipments are all new and solid. There's a incline chest press machine which is kinda rare but I hope y'all can rotate the position of the machine to facing the mirror instead haha thank you! Overall good vibes!,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21vMlpXSnBiMVJJU3pOalVHUjBjSHBVVWpGdU0xRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tampines 487,Muhammad Mustaffa,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Anytime Fitness – 487B Tampines Street 45

This gym truly feels like my second home. The location is perfect—just a short walk from my block—which makes it so easy to stay consistent. I love the 24/7 access, which lets me train whenever my schedule allows, and the gym is always clean, well-maintained, and welcoming.

The variety of equipment is great for both strength and cardio, especially for chest and Arms workout, absolute perfect,

and the staff are friendly and helpful, creating a supportive community vibe. It’s motivating to see familiar faces and feel at ease every time I step in.

💡 Small suggestion: It would be fantastic if they could add an abs workout machine to complete the already solid range of equipment.

Overall, a top-notch gym for anyone looking for convenience, flexibility, and a comfortable environment to work out in.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xrdGJtZERXa3BvVFRWallWQkpUa0pNVWtsYU1uYxAB
