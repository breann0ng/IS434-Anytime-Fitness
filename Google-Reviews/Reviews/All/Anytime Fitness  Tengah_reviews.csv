Anytime Fitness - Tengah,Benedict Correya,5,"Nice and clean gym with well-maintained equipment and a good variety for different workouts. The space feels comfortable and not too crowded.
One thing that could make the experience even better would be having a water dispenser inside the gym. Overall, a great place to work out in Tengah.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2kwMlFqaGpiV0p0TWtkMFRUTk9ZVXRuUzBkTlNIYxAB

Anytime Fitness - Tengah,CatineSkyii Sim,5,"Absolutely love this AF! The staff are friendly and greet you with a welcoming (sometimes cheeky 😆) smile. Friendly fun bunch of dudes who care about their community. I've not been to another AF that puts out bananas and candies for members. Or, creates challenges for us to have friendly competitions with one another. This AF feels more like a community than just a gym.

Shout-out to Taufiq, Iskandar, Khalis, Faiz and the lost boy Chrisson. 👋🏼😄",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21WMVFrbHVSMU5QWWs4ME1FTlhSRWhyWmtKMlowRRAB
Anytime Fitness - Tengah,Jairaj Jeyabal,5,"This is definitely one of the best gyms in the west. Amazing layout, really spacious, fantastic selection of equipment. A good range of free weights & plate loaded machines for those who like to lift heavy and an equally good variety of cable machines, functional equipment and cardio.

The staff are very friendly & helpful and I love the positive vibes and energy that they bring to this place. Highly recommended! I'm definitely going to make my trips to Tengah a weekly affair.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJZ2Yzai1nRRAB
Anytime Fitness - Tengah,yatassha abdul fattah (yatassha),5,"Absolutely love working out at Tengah Anytime Fitness! The classes are always fun and engaging, and the gym is consistently clean and well-maintained. The staff are incredibly jovial, helpful, and full of positive energy — they never fail to hype us up, especially as newbies just starting our fitness journey. Even after a long day, at 9pm, they still have the energy to cheer us on and keep the vibe alive. Their dedication, patience, and warm encouragement make all the difference. Thank you for making fitness feel fun and achievable!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xaYVVFUjVjbU51Y2paWlpVUklSVmt5VjI5dGQzYxAB
Anytime Fitness - Tengah,Huishan Lan,5,"Joining Anytime Fitness Tengah was one of my best decisions in life! It sounds like I’m exaggerating but honestly, I have joined other gyms in the past and the environment and vibes just didn’t make me feel motivated to continue, and others are just way too expensive.

Conversely, Anytime Fitness Tengah was super affordable and they offered a really clean and great environment - new machines, cool air-con, well-maintained cleanliness (I see cleaners doing their work all the time when I workout) and they have the most fun and bubbly team ever.

The full-time staff are all very friendly and motivating, and would often give good advice and explain concepts to help me achieve my fitness goals, even though I did not sign up for PT sessions. Even the intern was very helpful (he even demonstrated for me to see) when I approached him to explain to me about the machine that I have not tried before and he was there to make sure I was doing it right.

Recently, AF Tengah introduced group classes and we’ve formed a really supportive community where no one judges our fitness levels so it’s really just all of us having good fun working out together!

I never knew “suffering” could feel this good! 🤭",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWWmNqRmthMjVHVTBWVFVrOWljbXRxZFhOdlFYYxAB

Anytime Fitness - Tengah,Wyn,5,Great gym for residents staying in Tengah! Not as big as some anytime fitness but decent size for the amount of space we have. Gets pretty crowded towards night time regardless of weekdays or weekends so best to come in mornings or afternoons☺️,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GemJtdEdVbU5yVVRNNWFrNU5hamh4WjA5c2RIYxAB

Anytime Fitness - Tengah,h r,3,"AF Tengah is new with a small squarish layout. The equipment selection are very basic due to the size of the space. Becos of that, when the Tengah crowd comes in progressively, with more BTO around the estate getting ready, the whole gym may feel very packed easily.

Its hard for AF Tengah to convert more fitness enthu members from nearby gyms with better equipment. Eg, AF Tengah only has 2 power racks compared to AF Bukit Batok with 6 power racks. Probably can only attract people who stay in Tengah for convenience but dont drive.

Management may need to think ahead and reconfigure the equipment within the small unit to spread out the crowd in future. The loose furniture and resting area seems like taking a portion of the unit which may not be needed since the gym is in a residential area. For consideration please.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJLU9TLWVBEAE
Anytime Fitness - Tengah,Wen Liueh Kueh,4,One of the better branches with new equipments.. Except some of the machines need getting used to cause the latches can be a bit difficult to maneuver. Spacious and the temperature is nicely controlled. The machines can be quite close to each other so be careful when you walk between them when trying to stack your weights,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJNDdhX29nRRAB
