Anytime Fitness Tekka Place,Alexander Aaltonen,5,"This has gotta be one of my recent favorite AF branches! It offers a wide range of equipment, the standard ones as well as some rare ones too. The space is not too big, but they've used it efficiently to fit in machines, free weights and dl/squat platforms. So, all around a very functional gym! Also love their showering and changing room facilities, super clean and they provide the essential amenities!

Definitely can recommend this gym and would come back here for sure! 🦾🦿",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25WQmRXZzRjVnBqWmxGcFNsSmtRbFF3TVZZd1ZYYxAB

Anytime Fitness Tekka Place,Haroh Garcia,5,"I recently relocated my home gym to this gym, despite living quite far from it. This gym is new, clean, and equipped with the essential machines for a comprehensive daily workout routine. Unlike the nearby AF branches, it doesn’t get too overcrowded. Additionally, the gym offers complimentary snacks like bread with spreads, which I truly appreciate. One of the standout features is the free Evolt body composition machine, which is available to use anytime, unlike most AF branches where they charge for each scan. Furthermore, this branch boasts the best staff! They are professional and friendly, unlike many other AF branches where the staff consists mainly of part-time staff. I highly recommend this gym to many of my friends, and it never disappoints!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t4TlVWSlhiV3R6TlhodVdXMTVTVk5sVUhOcGIxRRAB

Anytime Fitness Tekka Place,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,5,"One of the newest outlets in Singapore. The gym has plenty of equipment variations for all muscle groups. There's 3 squat racks + 2 deadlift platforms but it's a bit cramped. The same goes for the dumbbell area. They provided sweets and snacks (bread station) for pre-, intra-, and post-workout replenishment. The shower/changing area is clean and they even have hair dryers and toiletries.

The service and smiles provided by Lucas and team are such a welcoming change from the other outlets. They also react promptly to request for assistance or feedback given.

Anytime Fitness Tekka Place,Rach Ang,3,"Months back I relocated to this branch, the gym is decent and properly maintained, staffs were friendly. Most times they would offer Bread or Bananas which as really nice.

I even renewed my membership with them, but there were some admin glitches. Initially I couldn't tap in, happened for the first 2 times after renewal, possibly due to the renewal of the membership, and then I got hit with late payment fee, even though I have provided the correct card information. When I tried to clarify it on whatsapp, I felt like the staff corresponding with me on whatsapp was avoiding my questions and kept insisting that it was because it was my fault that I pay late. I tried to point out that the last 4 digits of the card that they have keyed into EzPay was wrong (it was 0000). I understand that late payment will result in late payment fee and that is understood in the contract, but this was not the case. Long story short it was acknowledged that they've processed my card details wrongly, but I had to still pay $15 for this mistake.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tscmNXcHpNMmwyZEdSNlJWcG5lVWwyUjBSbFlWRRAB
