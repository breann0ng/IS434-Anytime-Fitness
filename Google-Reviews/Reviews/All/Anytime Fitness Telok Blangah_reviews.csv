"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",RAKESH YEDLAPALLI,1,"I’ve been a regular visitor to this branch for many months now, mainly because of its proximity to my home. However, the maintenance is seriously disappointing for a global gym brand like Anytime Fitness.There has been a treadmill marked “out of order” for over 8 months, and nothing has been done to fix or replace it. It feels like no one’s bothered to care.The equipment is limited overall – for the size of the crowd it gets, it often feels overcrowded.The restrooms are poorly maintained, usually dirty with bad sanitary conditions. There’s no dryer, no proper cleaning, and only one toilet, which is often not in usable condition.The resting area is small and uninviting, offering no place to cool down or wait.

While the staff are polite and friendly, the facility needs urgent attention and upkeep. If I had a better option nearby, I would have definitely considered switching. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously – the members deserve better for the price we pay.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xFdFMyZGhjbEpXUmt0S1QwYzBVbVJCVFVOWFYwRRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Brown Tings,1,"I’m honestly appalled by the condition of the gym especially considering there were floor staff present. As paying members, we expect at least the bare minimum in cleanliness, maintenance, and professionalism.

Despite the numerous 1-star reviews, I gave this gym a chance. But not only is the space poorly maintained, the staff has been consistently unhelpful and unprofessional. One staff member named Haziq, in particular, stood out for all the wrong reasons… I’ve witnessed the way he interacts with clients, and it’s far from acceptable.

Anytime Fitness, it’s time to seriously step up your game. This isn’t what members sign up for.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tReE1uaElaek5aTTJObWVWQlFSVFZwWTJ3ek0xRRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Lisa Zhang,1,"Been to other AF branches, this is probably the least maintained and most dreadful looking branch. There is a treadmill that's been marked ""out of order"" for months, and another one is unable to incline. There are only 4 treadmills in total, so 50% not fully functional. Had to go home last week as the remaining treadmills were used.

Bathrooms are filthy and smelly. The resting area is really uninviting, chairs are covered with stains.

Whilst the staff are polite and friendly, the facility needs urgent serious upkeep. I would switch to other gym in a heartbeat if there were another option nearby. I seriously urge the management to take necessary action immediately and not just pay lip service brushing off feedback.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2trMVozQnFNbVJ0U25KRlJqUm9jMFpHU1VSbFVIYxAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Anna Zai,5,"Great idea to have a gym in the neighbourhood since it caters to more people. The place feels more homely too. Having a bigger space and more room between the equipment would further enhance the overall gym experience.

Kenneth (PT) takes the time to understand what I can and can’t do, and adjusts the exercises to suit my needs. He shares helpful videos to keep me motivated.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMeVduc3pBOHUtUjNRRRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Ritesh Tonk,5,"Nice place with right set of machines, weights and free space.

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Robin Ong,5,"Telok Blangah AF is a medium-sized AF branch, but for its size I’d say that it is very well-equipped (having visited more than 15 branches in SG).

Visited on a weekday afternoon which had about 6-7 other users but it still felt well spaced-out and comfortable for use.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25wU2RuTjRWRTVrUWpOU2NHOXBSMjlIY0RGRk1rRRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Andrew Tan,1,"Probably the worst AF branch I’ve set foot upon. Very badly maintain, and even the smell of the gym like perfume was absolutely awful.

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",san chua,4,"The gym is not very big but good enough for neighborhood, equipment are generally well maintained, and staffs are very friendly and helpful!

But would be better if they have better music or softer, since everyone is wearing own earpiece, it was so loud that i could still hear it even if I tried to listen to my own music (i know this is very subjective, but really not a fan of the music)

Other than this, overall this is a really great neighborhood gym!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VQYmh5WkNzLXRDNzhnRRAB

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",khoo wan qing,1,"Freaking small like dog house. Smell like perfume and sweat mix together and marinate for a year, leak when rain, less equipment, no vanting system. The sanitary system sucks too. Less toilet and dirty, small resting place, no dryer or anything. No sense of privacy. If you want to have a feel of under the bridge like a bagger, can try this gym. Can't even quit even offer to pay more. Crap.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3NVlPLWxRRRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Angel Chuan,5,"Shoutout to my trainer Kenneth, despite his busy schedule, is always taking personal time to plan a programme for me, even though he ends work late he still puts the effort and time to plan things out for me nicely, ever since training with him i have improved a lot in my muaythai techniques and fitness level, he even guided me slowly and patiently when the technique is not right, he is precise when doing the training with me. He is the best trainer i had. Thanks to him i am able to fit into nice and beautiful dress again!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSMzhYY1JREAE

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Joanne Tan,5,"Recently signed up with AF TB and happy with the value it brings. Adequate equipment and it's usually not too crowded with mostly regular faces. Staff are friendly and I recommend my PT - Kenneth, who is patient with an amateur like me, pushing my fitness limits bit by bit yet reminding me to be mindful on potential injuries due to incorrect techniques or over-train.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuN2VqWFJnEAE
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Hera Sun,1,"Poor gym environment 👎🏻

There are two individuals at the gym who are creating an uncomfortable environment for others.

One consistently wears a singlet and the other has purple hair. They behave as if they own the place, making excessive noise and disrupting the atmosphere.

This issue is particularly noticeable in the evenings, and I hope the management takes steps to address it and restore a more pleasant and respectful environment for all gym-goers.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMdUl5UHd3RRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",lisa lee,5,"The staff who helped me with the membership paperwork were friendly and accommodating.

Members are respectful and keep to themselves from what I can see. Quite pleased so far.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiMzQ2TVN3EAE
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Ky Teo,5,"I've been a member of AF for a year now. The gym is conveniently located.

You'll be greeted by the staff with a friendly smile, and they remarkably remember almost every member's name.

The equipments are sufficient for a good workout, though some of the machines are a bit worn out, leading to abrasions from the badly peeled upholstery. I provided feedback to the staff, and it took a year for the upholstery to be replaced. Management should address feedback more promptly.

I engaged Kenneth as a personal trainer from day one and have never looked back. Kenneth makes the sessions lively and effective. I share my goals with him, and we work together to achieve them. Kenneth adjusts the workouts to suit my abilities and pushes me when needed.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0bDd2ZzRBRRAB
"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Hwee Ping Tan,5,"I have been training at AF@TB for many years, and I have to say the new management and my current PT (Kenneth) had motivated me to keep coming back consistently.

Kenneth have also been training me since July, I had enjoyed each session with him. He is extremely friendly and makes the training session pretty comfortable, yet he is very observant and knows when to push my limits.

I saw myself improving physically in strength and endurance, and most importantly I don't drag myself to gym anymore 🤩",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaLVB5ZWZ3EAE

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Ziping Shi,5,"Signed up a couple of weeks ago, facilities are great for me. Signed up for PT sessions as well, my PT trainer (Kenneth), a humourous dude, is always providing insightful tips during our sessions to better train myself, focusing on muscles etc. I saw a recent comment on the trainers which I find kind of amusing because my trainer is always busy and even us clients have to prebook him haha.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0MTRiN013EAE

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Tricia Teng,5,Have been going here for a little over a year and recently started training with Kenneth. He really pushes you to achieve your fitness goals while also being attentive to where your limits are. I like that it’s not always the same set of exercises when I go in for a session as Kenneth really tries to make things fun and varied and it makes me excited to go for gym now 😂 10/10 recommend,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKdnFEcVZnEAE

"Anytime Fitness, Telok Blangah",Jaspal Singh,5,"I have been training under the head coach/ Personal Trainer (Eh Saan) for awhile now and I must say that his knowledge and attention to detail is indeed amazing.

I have not been one to enjoy working out, but after a recent epiphany on needing to lose weight, he was whom I turned to for help.

I must say, not only do I find myself feeling a lot better, but I also can see myself losing weight and major improvements in my overall health and mobility.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NzhfMGtRRRAB
