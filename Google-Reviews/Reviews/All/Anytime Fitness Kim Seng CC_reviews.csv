Anytime Fitness Kim Seng CC,Satz,5,"I moved to Kim seng couple of months ago and then noticed this gym which was close to my house.
Wonderful gym with all the required equipments and a friendly staff. The gym is very clean and not crowded if you are to visit between 1-5pm. Equipments are brand new.
They have Zumba, Hatha Yoga, body combat, Yin yoga, muay thai, and pilates each day late evening as complimentary
The gym consists of two floors. The ground floor is for weights and the first floor is cardio and threadmill and free style.
The staff are very friendly. Specially Minn is very approachable and is open to suggestions and feedback. She even sorted out some confusions regarding the transfer of membership from keppel.
They also have refreshments in the form of banannas ;) ( a perfect post workout supplement ).
If you are around kim seng/Tiong bahru this without a shadow of doubt is a must visit gym if you still haven't.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4cS1pMVJBEAE

Anytime Fitness Kim Seng CC,Raymond Tan,5,"Longest Walk On A Treadmill In 24 Hours

My greatest gratitude to Anytime Fitness (Kim Seng CC Branch) in providing treadmill for my 24 hrs challenge.

Staffs (Sarah, Kevin and Sophia) have been very patient, providing me access to the treadmill for the challenge and standby 24/7 ensuring my safety on the equipment.

I am truly grateful to them 🙏🙏🙏",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtcFB6VFdBEAE
Anytime Fitness Kim Seng CC,Starry Snow,1,"I'm extremely let down by the lack of response, concern and most importantly accountability by both Kim Seng AF and its instructors for a ribcage injury i suffered during muay thai class last Saturday.

If you care about your safety during class, this is not the place to come as they do not care about nor manage the risks for you.

It was only my 2nd lesson for muay thai and the instructors (whom knew me from their previous kickboxing class) paired me with 2 much stronger and seasoned girls for long guard practice, for us to take turns to practise with one another.

One of the girls whom had partnered with me the week before and knew my level suddenly pushkicked me with considerable strength and i was taken aback. I felt pain on my tummy area and later on in the class when i informed the key instructor, he said a mild kick is ok even if i wasn't braced for impact. I practically skipped the latter part of group practice with the girls cos they were going at each other and i wasnt comfortable.

The pain persisted and i kept the instructor updated as it was so bad i couldnt sleep properly at night. Although he did respond, it was passive and i was just told to monitor it. I texted Kim Seng on sunday to inform about it and there was no reply since it was unstaffed which i understood.

On monday the pain and also bloatedness was still felt so i went to see a GP in the afternoon, n it was assessed that the pain came from the tip of my ribcage, meaning the push kick had been on my ribcage.

I updated both the key instructor and Kim Seng AF regarding the doc assessment. By then Kim Seng AF hadnt even responded to my initial text sent on sunday. When there was a reply, it was only an apology for late reply as the person standing in, a fitness instructor had been with a client. He said he would pass the message to the team for a follow up. I sent a text on tuesday to ask when can i expect a follow up, and there is no response at all, while i am writing this at 5ish pm on wed.

The key instructor's initial response to me was to deflect all responsibility, to it being an unfortunate event, claiming he cant control students' behavior and mistakes, that a push kick could be anywhere on the body as it is to simulate a street fight on defence and attack. That injuries are unavoidable. He assumed the girl's kick was unintentionally strong, even though he said he and the assistant instructor are unable to control n monitor everyone or give a person more attention to the other. Only after i persisted in my points on the lack of safety measures did he apologise on his carelessness.

Prior to this, i had a good impression of Kim Seng AF, of the instructors. So i even recommended my other gym frens from my previous AF to come here. They respond very fast when you ask about classes.

However when it comes to injury accountability, while I suffered an unnecessary painful injury, all that they responded was silence, deflecting of fault.

I do not find delight in writing this review. But if you want a safe environment and a gym that cares about your wellbeing, avoid this place.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvcW83a1hBEAE

Anytime Fitness Kim Seng CC,Christabelle Soh,5,"I've never been a gym rat and only started personal training recently as I've noticed that with age, it's become more difficult to play the sports I love (tennis and basketball) without proper conditioning.

Anytime Fitness Kim Seng CC,Teo Gerald,5,"Went in to this gym near my home and was very impressed with the comprehensive range of equipment over 2 floors.
The staff (Sarah and Sophia) were great and were responsive to my queries and friendly.
I Signed on an 18 mth package and was entitled to a free 1hr session with Trainer Kevin.
Kevin was very professional and meticulous in his explanation and guided me through the range of exercises on all the machines.
After that session, I decided to sign up PT package under him. He was very attentive and focused on working with me to meet my goals in that short span of 4 months.

Every session, Kevin would make PT very exciting as he introduced to me many variations of exercises on each machine and opened my mind about all the different muscle groups in our limbs.
I was learning alot of new workouts targeting different muscle groups each time and soon enough I saw the results I wanted.

I have absolutely no regrets signing up under him and it has been a life changing experience!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcnZDNWhBRRAB
