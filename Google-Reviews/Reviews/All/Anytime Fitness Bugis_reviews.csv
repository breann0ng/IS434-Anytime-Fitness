Anytime Fitness Bugis,Sihan Goi,5,"A pretty decent gym spread across the 3rd and 4th floors of a commercial building at the junction of Middle Road and another small lane.
3rd floor has cardio machines, cable machines, a few plate loaded machines, dumbbells up to 30kg, 2 power racks, a Smith machine, benches. 4th floor gets more serious with 6 power racks with attached platforms (but somehow only 5 barbells), a hex bar, a short bar, ez bar, fixed bars, benches, dumbbells up to 50kg, plate loaded machines, bumper plates and rubberized plates.
About the barbells, I remember seeing Eleiko bars advertised, but the 5 bars there were brandless hybrid bars with both PL and WL markings on a rather smooth knurl, so you may have grip issues if lifting heavy. Thankfully, all of them spin OK. Perhaps the Eleiko bars (if they have any) are kept during non staffed hours like some other clubs.

There is a sign at the corner platform that allows chalk usage only there, which is better than pretty much any other AF I've been to since they all disallow chalk usage. You do have up clean up after yourself but that's to be expected.

Went there around 7am on a Friday and trained until around 9am, crowd was also non existent. Not much to complain about equipment wise, except maybe a lack of warmup equipment such as foam rollers, bands, etc, or a space to warm up at. However, facilities wise, there are only 2 shower stalls per floor, and no space to change outside of the stall. I generally don't like to put on my clothes in the shower area since the floors are wet, but in this case there wasn't much choice.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJbnpwdXpkcXFTM1F3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bugis,Kaffestor,1,"Some may think this is witty or punny,
but it’s actually crude and tone-deaf.
It misses the basic sense of professionalism -
forgetting that these are paying customers,
not gymmates in a locker room joke circle. Whoever thought of this lacks basic understanding of branding elements.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwWGNVdDFUVkV5WlhoVk5FWmZXVkZzWW1JeFprRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bugis,Syahiran,5,"Outstanding gym with extremely cozy and comfortable setting. Amazing atmosphere with cool music to vibe to.

I love the uniqueness of this gym as it has 3 separate levels. The lighting of the gym is perfect for aesthetics.

Each one has a pretty specific workout theme, being 3rd floor -cardio 4th floor-weights and 5th floor is the open area for classes and sandbag/kettlebell etc. aircon is comfortable. Music playlist is pretty mainstream so it won’t go wrong. A total of 4 shared showers, 2 toilets for each gender(single cubicle) but thank god there aren’t any urinals so it is clean. Staff are friendly and welcoming too.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pBNVRISlZNQzF2UzBab1FUZEdRMlkyVVVGbFEwRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bugis,T L,1,"I honestly don’t even know where to begin with how disgusted I am by the state of this this gym. I’ve been a member for a while, but the recent months bathroom experience was so vile it might just be the last straw.

A wretched, persistent yellow substance is clearly visible on the toilet bowl. I can’t even begin to fathom how unsanitary that is. Who is responsible for cleaning this place, and why aren’t they doing their job? Apparently it seems that this has been going on for the last couple months. Unsure if they’re trying to cut costs by not hiring a cleaner for this outlet but it’s the worst decision management could make. Instead of letting your part time secondary school employees do the cleaning please hire a professional.

This gym had huge potential. Central location, easily accessible and one of the best lighting amongst other clubs with the purple lights. It’s a shame they had to compromise on hygiene and cleanliness. Floors were sticky and everywhere looked like it hasn’t been cleaned for a good amount of time.

For the sake of your own mental health (and physical health), do yourself a favor and avoid this gym unless you want to deal with an absolutely wretched bathroom experience. Until they deal with this, it’s best you look for somewhere else to go.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25wUVJDMTFibGxHUTJaQlgyOUliMjk1Tlc1elZYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bugis,Hao Wu,3,"The Bugis anytime fitness gym has great equipment and friendly, helpful staff. I really enjoy working out here, the machines are well-maintained and there’s a good variety for all types of training.
However, the cleanliness of the showers and toilets needs serious improvement. They’re often dirty and not well-kept, which takes away from the overall experience.
Hope management can address this soon, as it would make the gym much more enjoyable for everyone.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pGTVRWOTBYMkZRZEdRMGJWWmlNakUyZG5BMU5YYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bugis,Hafizh Shah,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5 – Great Gym with a Welcoming Atmosphere

I’ve been a member at Anytime Fitness for a while now, and it’s been an awesome experience. One of the best things about this gym is the convenience—being open 24/7 makes it incredibly easy to fit a workout into a busy schedule, no matter the time of day.

The facility is always clean, organized, and well-equipped with everything you need—whether you're into weight training, cardio, or functional fitness. The equipment is modern and well-maintained, and I rarely have to wait to use anything.

What really makes this location stand out is the friendly and supportive staff. The team here is welcoming, knowledgeable, and always willing to help, whether you’re just getting started or need advice on leveling up your routine. They create a community vibe that makes working out more enjoyable and less intimidating.

There are also personal training options and group sessions if you want some extra motivation or structure in your workouts. I’ve seen real progress since joining, and I feel stronger and more energized.

Highly recommend Anytime Fitness if you're looking for a clean, safe, and flexible gym with a great atmosphere!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VQeTktc1BUczRySllBEAE

I especially appreciate the variety of equipment and number of racks available, compared to other branches.

The only issue is it’s good location, which can cause it to be very crowded most of the time.

Found out my auto payment did not go through as my card was changed by the bank due to fraud transactions. Contacted them immediately when I saw the email but they said I would have to pay an egregious 20% late fee and refused to waive it even if I've been a loyal member and it's not my fault and was willing to immediately address it.

Cancelled my subscription. It's okay, many competitors in the area who have more reasonable policies. Also, gym itself isn't that great anyway. Small and subpar equipment.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t4aFducGhaM1JIVjBaaFprOUhObkpLVkZZMk5XYxAB

4 hammerstrength power racks w platform. Wood platform is slippery for proper legdrive, as with hammer strength platforms. 3 powerlifting comp eleiko bars avail from 12-10pm (weekdays)
Life-fitness benches, which are wide and sufficiently grippy, but a little lower than competition benches.
1 rack allows chalk, with brushes provided- a good compromise from their sister outlets. Plate storage is well thought out as well.
2 hammer strength half racks on lvl3 without platform.

Anytime Fitness Bugis,R. V.,1,"""we hope you are able to find a gym that has 0 music playing""

This is the extremely polite and professional response that Anytime Fitness Bugis sent me  in an unsigned email, after I asked them to consider turning the music down. It plays an extremely loud volume (audible over noise cancelling headphones). For the record, it is very easy to find a gym that music playing at a reasonable volume, and where the staff are polite and responsive to customer concernsm and don't send emails like this. That gym is not Anytime Bugis. While the facilities are fine, this attitude is the main reason I would not recommend this gym.

I generally don't write Google Reviews but I got an email from Anytime asking me to review them online after I terminated my membership. So, here it is, as requested.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBcXRtbUlREAE

Not because of the gym itself. It’s quite acceptable, despite that it’s spread out over three floors and you have to walk up and down between exercises. No, it’s not that.

The mix of workout equipment is also good which makes it popular among gymmers, especially when it has a lot of barbell stations! However, with its location and good mix of equipment, this gym is quite crowded especially on weekday evenings up to 11pm.

Anytime Fitness Bugis,Justinian Tabucanon,1,"I visited Singapore recently for a few days about 2 weeks ago. I wanted to have a decent work out in Singapore, because I know that I would be eating heaps of treats around the country.

I recently signed up for an Anytime fitness in Australia, and I was still on my 3rd week on my membership. So, as per my contract, this meant I couldn't go to any Anytime Fitness locations aside from the one I singed up for.

Before going on my trip, I asked my local Anytime Fitness whether it would be possible for me to go to Singapore and whether I would be able to train there for 2 days (not even a week, only a couple of sessions), since I didn't want to lose track of my fitness progress. My local gym advised me that it should be ok, since they would usually have people from other Australian States, and from overseas that have the same issue as me, but they would just let them train since they are still part of the community.

So, I went to Singapore, and I walked all the way to this branch (Bugis branch?), and I was denied access by the staff stating that they could not possibly accommodate my fitness needs since I am still within the one month clause of my contract. They didn't even offer a free one time session for that day.

It is frustrating as well because now, I couldn't pause my membership after the rejection.

It just hurts to know that this branch (and I hope this does not reflect the whole company/franchise) does not care as much about your fitness goals. I understand the law, and I know that they did it under their jurisdiction. But, from a customer service perspective, it is definitely a 1 star experience for me.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNob2EyNHFRRRAB

While both my friend and I are paying members of AF, they reached out to us and insisted that I pay the tailgating fee of $60. I thought it was both illogical and ridiculous that paying members of the gym have to pay that $60 fine even after verification that we are indeed members. I mean I get it if one of us were a guest…

Anytime Fitness Bugis,Stevie Wander,5,"The location of this gym is already a win as it is between Suntec and Bugis, there is no shortage of good food for the post-workout bulk. If you need 800 calories char kway teow for dirty bulking just turn left upon exit and walk to Albert food centre.

There are 2 floors, level 3 and 4. Level 3 has more machines and threadmills, if you want to hit isolated muscle parts without free weights and run (Though running on concrete is generally much better).

Level 4 is where you see the Ronnie Coleman - ish lifters whom you will be proud to ask for help if you ever have a renovation and need some movers. There are cable machines, at least 8 benches, and 4 squat racks. Very spacious and less narrow than mall gyms.

You can access the gym using the lift or stairs, I prefer the stairs as I loveeeee legs day. Legs day are awesome, I like the feeling after great squats and deadlifts I walk down one step at a time. Don’t skip leg days (no really you will just look imbalance)

Anytime Bugis is a good choice for beginners or new year resolutioners who stop coming after a month. It has ample machines and free weights, just take note 6pm - 8.30pm on weekdays it is crowded. Weekends generally empty, and Monday is International Chest Day so good luck finding a bench or rack in the evening.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcGJqSFlnEAE

Anytime Fitness Bugis,Neo Kung,5,"Anytime Fitness near Bugis is open all the time, but not always crowded. I went on a weekday evening to register for a membership and happened to get a 20% discount, making it SGD 95 per month. However, you need to buy a key fob, which isn't cheap at SGD 85, but it grants access to branches worldwide, which is quite attractive. It has two floors, and you need a key fob to enter. The equipment is clean and quite complete. The space is small but well-planned. It wasn't too crowded in the evening. There are showers, lockers, and lockers. Lockers are first-come, first-served, and you have to lock them yourself; most people didn't lock them.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxNElIWG9nRRAB
