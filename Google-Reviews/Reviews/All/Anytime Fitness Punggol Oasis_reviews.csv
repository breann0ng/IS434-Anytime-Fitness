I first joined AF in mid-2023, and even though I’ve since shifted my home gym from Punggol Oasis to Harbourfront and now Wheelock Place, I still find myself coming back from time to time.

Coach Joel and Coach Damia are always attentive, guiding their clients with well-structured and personalized training routines. Carlos, on the other hand, consistently makes newcomers feel welcome, greeting everyone with genuine warmth and care.

For anyone living around Punggol, I highly recommend this branch. The gym is well-maintained, clean, and equipped with regularly sanitized machines that make training here both safe and enjoyable.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xVd01HcHJWakJ5YUROTE1uWnlTRlI2VERNeVpGRRAB

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,S N,5,"Just moved into Singapore, and this gym is already my second home!!
I've been weight training for the past 5 years and visited several other AF locations in and out the country, but AF Oasis has changed my perspective of AF with their welcoming and skill full trainers.
The plates and dumbbells are well placed which tells the members here are well mannered and staff are watching out. I also like how the equipments are thoughtfully placed. Racks, benches and platforms get a mirror view but the booty builder and back extension roman chair is facing a wall so I don't need to worry about being in an uncomfortable position during my reps. Not to forget the spacious functional area that made me want to incorporate kettlebells as my new routine and it has leveled up my performance. I also enjoyed the night class (Muay Thai) and would like to find time to incorporate more into my fitness routine.
They are quite active in Instagram and love to see their hilarious posts 😂 (no pressure on the staff🙏 there's informative posts too.).

Such a privilege to have you in my neighbor. Thanks for all the efforts in making this gym a wonderful place.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21wWk0xSmlUR2xFU2toSmNHcGpObmhXTjNWaU9IYxAB
Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Sihan Goi,4,"Pretty good outlet with a decent free weights area - 1 hammer strength platform (careful with your shins as the middle of the rubber mats are depressed) , 2 hammer strength racks, and I counted 3 Ziva bars and 3 benches, a mix of rubberised and Ziva bumper plates as well. There's also a semi outdoor patio area with kettlebells, foam roller, boxes, C2 rower, swiss and med balls, and boxing bag. Actually there's also a rack, barbell and wheeled prowler outside but they are locked up and not in use, presumably because some people complained about the noise (judging from the posted notices on the way out to the patio). A pity though, because it seems like a nice place to push the prowler and lift some weights in the rack. Oh there's also a sad looking hyperextension machine in the purgatory between the indoor and outdoor area, like how do you even use it in that small space?",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdDZ6SE9REAE

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Munny L,4,"Upon entering you'll be identified, the gym has 1 locker and 1 cubby shelf. 1 female dedicted washroom and 3 washrooms in total. Hair drying spot at the corner of the corridor. Soap is well stocked and provided. They also have a vending machine with protein and a standard water cooler.

They have every machine needed!
A dedicated spot for a couple of Treadmills, ellipticals, bicycles and 1 stair master
Weightlifting area is in the middle with:
2 squat racks and 1 smith machine
Free weights, barbells
2 leg press machines
Bench presses
Adductor machine
2 bench press machines
Row, lat pull machine, chest fly, shoulder press, leg curl, leg extension
Cable machine with pull up bar

Though there's not alot of walking space in the whole gym, so users really stand close to each other.

Best part of OasisAF is the outdoor patio that's equipped with kettle bells, yoga mats and a huge space to workout in. They have a cable machine outdoors. A row machine and a (not so popular) back extension bench. The patio is surrounded by mirrors. It's closed to users when there are group classes going on from time to time.

There's no inbody machine for weight measurement, but just your good old traditional weighing machine.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQydzRlMHZRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Calvin Tan,5,"My “Wanton Mee” Trainer- Troy.

I want to extend my deepest appreciation to my Personal Trainer Mr Troy Tan for the incredible transformation I’ve experienced under his guidance.

When I began this journey, my goals were clear: to lose weight and regain my long lost body fitness by building strength across key muscle groups. Thanks to Troy’s tailored workouts, unwavering encouragement, and deep understanding of fitness and body mechanics, I’ve not only achieved those goals but exceeded my own expectations.

To be frank, I wasn’t 100% convinced signing up PT at AF was the right decision for me in the past. Before meeting Troy, there was this long-lingering self-doubt on my own physical fitness being able to match up to a PT’s “demands”. Before knowing Troy, the PT in my mind was the less than ideal image PTIs often portray from NS days. It isn’t hard for many to identify our NS days’ PTIs being stern, authoritative, and even condescending.

Thankfully, Troy is nothing like the said above. He has the right technical skills matched with the right soft skills. He has the complete package - the brains, the physique, and the handsome face to match (envy).

Troy has a rare ability to push just the right amount—challenging me without overwhelming me, motivating without pressuring. His consistency, professionalism, and positive energy made every session something I looked forward to, and his holistic approach to fitness helped me build healthier habits beyond the gym.

He matches science to psychology. He knows the human mind to a point I wonder why wasn’t he a clinical psychologist. He knows what one is thinking for that little nudge when one is thinking of giving up. He pushes your limits in a non-invasive way, a way so natural until I myself don’t even know I had actually improved from my last personal best.

His care goes beyond the confines of the gym space. He embraces overall nutrition with what food nutrition and lifestyle changes I needed to make. I still recall in the earlier sessions when he asked what I had for lunch. His face (I still remember that face) when I told him “wanton mee” spoke a thousand words. Maybe it’s what one can relate casually as “bombastic side eye”. This simple wanton mee was enough to trigger a candid whole conversation of what foods to avoid and why.

Expectations vs Results: I recall I gave myself a 6 months timeline to achieve my weight loss and fitness targets. A short 3-4 weeks in, I started having people around me going “You lost weight!”, “You look better now. What did you do?”, and of course “the tummy is gone!”. Nothing proves results than such remarks to match the better breathing and “lightness” I myself felt during this journey. A whole 2 months in to today, I have also advanced to needing a whole new wardrobe change (woohoo!).

Lastly, I am glad I did this first step 2 months ago. Getting to know Troy and the AF Oasis crew changed my life. I thereby wholeheartedly recommend Troy to anyone serious about reaching their fitness goals. His dedication and skill make him truly exceptional.

Thank you!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VPS1I4b2VPbXJtN21nRRAB

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Arvind Aaswani,1,"I had a regrettable experience with Anytime Fitness last year. Opting for a 1-year contract seemed enticing, but I soon discovered there was no option to cancel before the term ended. Despite not using their services, the gym showed no interest in my attendance until the membership was about to expire.

Throughout the year, they never inquired about my absence, but as my membership expiration neared, they aggressively pursued renewal with enticing offers. Declining the renewal, they then insisted on a hefty SGD 99.14 cancellation fee, showcasing their focus on financial gains rather than member well-being.

The lack of communication and support for members who weren't actively attending raises concerns about their priorities. My advice: take your time before signing any agreements, as some gyms seem more interested in membership numbers than promoting a healthy lifestyle.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROMjZYRC1BRRAB

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Michael Scott,2,"The gym provides sufficient equipment for your exercising needs and you'd have a good time if you join with the foundational mentality that you're paying for a gym without staff because of how ill-trained and feedback-resistant the general staff are.

Over time, you'll witness the general lack of care from staff about the gym and they spend more time having fun and chatter in the office than making sure the place is operating at peak environment. Throughout the time period of covid, measures were not upheld, patrons without masks everywhere chatting with each other. You'll see fellow patrons without towels leaving sweat puddles on benches and staff not bothering with this gym 'rule'. Writing in to staff, you often meet more confrontational personalities than common-sense, customer-oriented approaches.

If you're able to get beyond the state of the general staff, you'd have a decent workout here.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2djRTOFV3EAE
Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Charlotte (11pmposts),2,"Gym is alright, with outdoor space. Administration has a lot of room for improvement. It’ll be difficult for u to pause on holiday unlike other anytime outlets if u sign up here. They charge at the 1st of every month so u can’t pause anytime between the month if u already paid.

Eg. If u booked a travel on 18th Sept
-U can only pause if it’s done before September

U can’t do impromptu trips and u must inform them way in advanced because they only process it when they have time for it and not on the dates u requested for.

They only pause when they have time to look at ur emails (that is not within the few days of sending) and they don’t reply sometimes unless you keep prompting. So
You will also need to be the one to constantly follow up on them/ WhatsApp them to remind them on this because they don’t reply ur emails.

The staff replying on whatspp is friendly and replies within a day but he/she isn’t the one in charge of pausing ur membership and can do nothing on it.

A lot of room for improvement for thegym administration to streamline the process and they also need to state or have clearer instructions on what’s required from the member’s end for pauses as they don’t tell u before that. So, there’s a lot of back and forth for such an easy process.

Frustrating to deal with, would recommend signing with a different branch for an easier fuss-free experience.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1OUtlM3F3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Akshay Saxena,3,"Here is my review for Anytime fitness Oasis outlet, after 8 months of joining them.

Reason for joining- Although, I do have a small gym in condo, but I wanted to get Personal Trainer for some time, and hence joined a gym nearby to my place.

Personal Trainer - Good experience while training with Darren. We went through multiple changes in training schedule to figure out what best suites me.

Gym interior - Really outdated and demotivating, seriously need a revamp and proper structuring of quipments.

Equipments quality - I can say it’s ok, and an area of improvement.

Equipments availability - Rack and benches are really low in number. Again the placement of equipments makes it a congested place, specially during peak hours, this is a major area of improvement.

Bathroom, changing and locker facilities - Below standard and should be improved with proper changing rooms and toilets.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bnV1WjlnRRAB

Educated me on different kinds of exercises, why we are doing it and what effect it will have. He also let me know all the Do’s and donts regarding weight lifting.

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,April Fae Amparado,1,"I went to the gym and talked to the staff regarding membership cancellation concern but the staff (manager) was rude and failed to handle the subject in a good manner. POLITENESS is everything. His approach in the beginning and mid of our conversation turned me off completely. The staff only changed his tone when my friend came to the office too. Apparently, there has been a miscommunication between my friends, me, and two of the staff before that led me to expressing my intention personally. I understand that as a member, we have to stick to the agreement but I will not tolerate a “very good” attitude.

Learning to gym is definitely achievable through watching youtube videos but without Darren, i think i’ll still be struggling to even nail down my basic techniques and will probably be unmotivated to workout. I have nothing but positive words to describe Darren. He’s not only a great PT, he has also become a good friend to me too!

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Demi Bear,1,"As I can see from previous one star reviews, it seems that this franchise has not changed. The staff is still extremely rude with regards to cancellation of membership. Staff whatsapped asking for a renewal, to which the reply was NO. Apparently that reply fell on deaf ears bc there was a charge AGAIN for this month. Staff then proceeded to suddenly say it had to be via and 30 days prior.

This was not established earlier and the staff blamed it on not reading the agreement. I read it and it said it had to be done in writing which was done so via whatsapp. What is the point of BLATANTLY asking for a renewal if it is to be of no use.

Staff was EXTREMELY rude and interrogative. If i could give 0 or negative reviews, i would. If the general manager or whosoever, and not the staff that handled this matter as it was clearly not handled well, contact me. This is utterly unacceptable and inappropriate. This could have been handled in a much MUCH better way. I am extremely enraged and disappointed.

Anytime Fitness Punggol Oasis,Hansel,3,"Thank you for the feedback Hansel. As a business, we need to ensure that we cater to the needs of all members, and allocate the limited space on the gym floor between free weights, stacked weights, cardio, functional training etc. Besides the equipment mandated by the franchisor, we also invested in additional pieces of equipment, which perhaps made the gym a little more cramped. However, we believe most members appreciate the fact that we tried our best to provide more value to them. In respect of the equipment layout, we had actually consulted with and leveraged the expertise of the top equipment suppliers in Singapore to make the layout as efficient as possible. That said, if you have any specific suggestion for improving the equipment alignment, please let us know! :)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4al9MeEtREAE
