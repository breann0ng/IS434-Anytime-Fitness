Anytime Fitness Marsiling MRT,Mohd Indra,4,"- Small and compact gym. It has 2 level, split in free weight section and machine weight, walking distance from MRT, polyclinic (if you need) and food places. I will expect that peak hours will be extremely squeeze.

- Cardio Machine are facing the road and the walk way so kind of a sad view and people will definitely look at you

- Went on a weekend mid-day, wasnt crowed, can say 6 machine on each floors were occupied with people.

- Equipment wise all are from Hammer or Life Fitness and still new as of today.

Anytime Fitness Marsiling MRT,john ng,1,"Very disappointing experience with this gym. Unlike other gyms that allow walk-in trials, this one insists on a one-day advance booking — yet even after following that rule and emailing as instructed, I was rejected twice. Each time, I was told they were understaffed. If you can’t accommodate trial bookings even with advance notice, then don’t advertise them. Poor organization and lack of reliability left a bad first impression.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZckppdlpnEAE
Anytime Fitness Marsiling MRT,Nathanael Khoo,5,"Hands down the best gym in the north of Singapore.

The ambiance and attention to detail to the decor is top notch. The machines are also strategically placed. First floor for machines and second floor for free weights. Love how the management invested into Hammer Strength equipment as well. Their machines are top-notch man.

You can tell the management did some really great planning.

I was working out and saw a gigachad pressing 45kg dumbbells. You know the gym is great if a gigachad like him chooses to workout here.

For me, it's an awesome place to sweat it out and become aesthetic af. Just being here motivates me.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMZzR6eG5BRRAB
Anytime Fitness Marsiling MRT,Andy,5,The best anytime fitness gym. I’m not writing this review because I was told to but because I want to. Their staff are friendly and approachable with really professional advice. Love the cleanliness of this new gym. Lots of machine with unique exercises. Although it can be small but very cozy and usually not full. They don’t hard sell and won’t charge you for anything extra unlike some other gym at woodlands where they will find any opportunity to charge you I think soon they might charge for water too if they can. Marsiling mrt gym is the best by far.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5eExXbWVBEAE
Anytime Fitness Marsiling MRT,Spartan Dan,5,"One of the best AF I've been too. Though space rather small. It's still enough to move around freely.
2 squat racks, one deadlift platform. Plenty of weights.
And best of all 5 toilets. Wah this one most AF lost at this. 2 water coolers as well.
Keep it up. Might be the AF I'll go for in the north.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6cmRMZS1RRRAB
