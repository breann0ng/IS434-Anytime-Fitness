Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,khrhms,4,Great AF outlet in the CBD area. Relatively spacious and not too busy after 6pm on a weekday. Showers available outside. Good range of machines and free weights available too. Awesome place for weekends workout because it’s relatively empty.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Arjun Kharidehal,1,"Many of the 5 star reviews seem to be of another branch as the photos are all inaccurate.

One star because the actual branch at 139 Cecil Street has one of the worst, horrible, smelly, non-ventilated toilets compared to any other gym across while of SG.

I've highlighted this many times to the AF team but they don't care it seems. If you are the kind who needs to shower after your workout, AVOID THIS GYM.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Daniel Ng,4,"Kind of a run of the mill AF. Nothing really unique about it but comes with the bare minimum of any AF. 2 squat racks, one deadlift platform, one smith machine and DBs only go up to 45kg. The gym is relatively spacious but the freeweight area is elevated so be careful not to trip.

Toilets are outside the gym and not the most convenient to shower in or put your stuff,  because there's only one small bench.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,CZW,5,Convenient gym for folks in the CBD area. Not too crowded in the evenings. Nice to be able to gym with colleagues. Look for Zac to get more info if interested to know more.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Giselle Toh,5,"I am thoroughly impressed with the exceptional experience I had at this Anytime Fitness outlet. The extensive range of high-quality equipment caters to all fitness needs, and the spacious layout enhances the workout environment. The staff members are not only friendly but also remarkably approachable, always ready to assist. The convenient accessibility of the location adds to the overall convenience, making it a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a stellar fitness facility.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Ben Evans,1,"Unfortunately this is a gym in major need of a revamp. The gym is echo-y and any drop of the weight will reverberate around the gym. The weight area is all supported by a incredibly worn out tarmac and every vibration can be felt.

However, that is not the worst part. The toilets of this gym may be the worst I have ever seen. No sense of cleanliness at all. Whether it is the morning, afternoon or evening, the toilet smells horrific and is incredibly dirty. The shower cubicles stink of something I do not want to think of and honestly it is just a horrible experience.

I would rather recommend Raffles Place down the road or Tanjong Pagar. This AF needs to be renovated as soon as possible.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Chun2,2,"It’s an okay gym, it’s a little hard to locate as there no signage or indication of where the outlet is exactly located(E.G which floor) Only managed to find thru google search,

It’s also listed as a gym with pool but there’s no directions on how to get there from the gym.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Edmund JP,4,"I recently visited Anytime Fitness during a business trip to Singapore, and overall, it served its purpose for a quick workout. The gym offers plenty of benches and has a well-equipped setup. However, my experience was slightly marred by a broken vending machine that failed to dispatch my protein shake purchase. Despite this inconvenience, the gym deserves a solid 4/5 stars for its convenient location, well-maintained equipment, and overall functionality.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Ling Lan,5,"spacious and clean environment. it is very quiet and very beginner-friendly as its my first time signing for gym, and equipments have instructions on teaching. it has spaces for classes like yoga etc but have yet to try.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Low Desiree,5,"AF Cecil has been my go-to gym because it’s the nearest to my office and most convenient for me. Gym is relatively big and has most of the equipment I need.

Zac from AF Cecil was also extremely proactive, answered all my questions and made the sign-up process extremely smooth.

He helped my friends sign up seamlessly. My friends were in the middle of a work event and he drove down to help them register at our lobby. Never seen this kind of service before 💪🏼 thanks Zac!",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Karin Ng,3,"Location was a tad bit difficult to find. Went there a few times and didnt really feel comfortable in the gym. Equipments/Weights were all over for the times that I went, felt quite lupsup because it is not neat at all. Everything is mostly on the floor and I have to go around to find the weights that I want too. Saving grace is that the gym is quite spacious and the staff is friendly too. However, perfect if you work in the CBD area. Changing room is inside, toilet and shower have to go out of the gym and is slightly tight and squeezy.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Darren Chong,1,"Charging a $15 late payment fee just because payment fail to go through is absolutely atrocious. Disgusted with both anytime fitness and Ezypay. It's not like I do not want to pay, there was some error and payment didn't go through, and we have to pay the fee cuz of some system error? Also disappointed in Anytime fitness because for some reason they swapped my main/parent outlet to Cecil street and the charging of the monthly payment changed days, without any prior notice or warning, and because of this I was charged for the late fee. Extremely disappointed, I have been a member for 5 years and counting and nvr failed to pay, just for one time the company insists on the late payment. Will be cancelling my membership soon to seek services elsewhere, absolutely thrash customer and user experience.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Micky P,2,"Probably the worst kept AF I’ve been to. Very run down, small, bad layout and mouldy. Good location though 🤷🏼‍♂️ …",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Ronald Soh,4,"Staff are fantastic, have not run into any issues with them so far. Equipment-wise, there are limitations due to the size of the place. Would have preferred for there to be more equipment and space at the free/heavy weights area since its usually the most popular.  Place gets quite crowded at the peak hours due to its location. Some of the members aren't very mindful but I'm not taking points away. Would be nice if there could be more lockers, too.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Nick Johnson,5,"It was a nice gym, a little hard to find at first. You need to take an elevator from an office type lobby to get to the gym and then you need a keycard from there.

A lot of nice equipment and the basics, also lockers and vending machines.

They have a nice pool on a higher floor that no one seemed to use at the time. I guess Singaporeans just don't swim much or something.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Kelvin Ang,5,Well maintained and spacious at a prime location with a good view - minutes walk from train station. It was good while it lasts…. Gym is undergoing relocation and will reopen in Jul/Aug around the same area.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Ys Ng,1,"Had a terrible experience with Anytime Fitness at Cecil Street. I cancelled my membership back in April, informing them both via email and WhatsApp that I wouldn’t be renewing. Despite that, they continued to charge me in October! This is completely unacceptable.
It feels like they’re just trying to scam members by ignoring cancellation requests and continuing to charge fees. If you’re considering joining, be aware of how poorly they handle cancellations and communication. I’m now forced to demand a refund for the October fee and am considering legal action if this isn’t resolved. Absolutely disappointed with the way this was handled. Stay away from this gym if you value transparency and good customer service!",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Tony Chen,4,"The location is good for people working nearby. It's spacious and clean environment. For beginners it is not bad.
However, the male toilet is a bit small (only 2 shower rooms)",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Yit Ying Kuan,5,"It's my first gym membership and I'm loving it ❤️  No comment on their gym equipment cos' I'm only there for the swimming pool and the studio space. The pool is always clean and empty during lunch and you'll get all the sun you want! The studio space is also more than enough for me to practice my ballet, just that it's sometimes a little dusty. Teehee.

Yoga classes are included in the monthly membership fee. For the lesson quality, it's definitely more than its worth. OH, i like how they drop reminders before classes too😀

As for the ladies bathroom, it's 2 in 1 with the toilet. Not very comfy but still works. The hairdryer is better than the one i have at home, so I'm  more than happy to workout there before work or during lunch every day.

Staffs are friendly and helpful, and its always nice to talk to them. All in all, love it and it made me stick to my not-so-intense workout plans. Yay!

18 Apr 2024: Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to go to gym for a long period of time, so I wanted to cancel my membership. The staff suggested to freeze my account instead of cancelling it, as my case is within the clause for freezing the account (I didn't know about this option.) I'm glad that the staff is well versed with the t&c and gave me the most suitable option. Cheers!",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Shen Wei,5,"Great location if you work in CBD and want to hit the gym during lunch. Facilities are clean, weights area isn’t too cluttered and ample space all around to do your exercise. Staff are friendly and helpful too!",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Zihui Lim,5,"Really love the convenience of the location! Equipments are new and clean. Spacious gym with really friendly staffs too. My PT - Marlon is very encouraging and does an amazing job in pushing me and helping me to achieve my fitness goals. Really appreciate every session with him! Even though I always joke that he is killing me slowly with all the exercises, but I feel so refreshed and energised after every session.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,kai,4,"Honestly 4.5 rather than a 4.

Spacious and well-equipped gym located at the heart of CBD, staff have always been very nice and helpful.

Termination process was surprisingly very smooth (was expecting a nightmare given the negative experiences shared online about other AF)

Highly recommend, overall a positive experience apart from the occasional Wifi issues.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Aviral Bhargava,3,"Decent sized gym with decent equipment. Enough to get your basic workouts in. I also like that an iron and ironing board are available to get your clothes ironed before heading to work.

However, the shower cubicles can be improved. For the gents, this toilet is used in conjunction with the urinals and the shower cubicles are really small as well. Basic shower gel etc are not provided either. A shocker knowing that this gym is in the CBD area and such standards for the toilets are followed.

Have messaged the staff a month ago about improvements etc but no response from them since. Hopefully something is done to improve in this issue.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,milkhoneywine x,5,"I love this AF branch. It’s always clean, the air conditioning is powerful, and the staff are nice. I enjoyed working out a great deal here. It’s also a fairly accessible spot, and has pool access on the rooftop! Can’t wait to come back and train here.

Karan has been an amazing trainer. I’ve been working with him for the past couple of months, and he’s been kind, understanding, and accommodating. I’m brand-new to fitness, and that should be a real challenge, but Karan has made our gym sessions incredibly fun and inspiring. He’s patient and meets me where I am, while also encouraging me to gently push through and achieve my fitness goals. I went from doing 50KG linear leg presses to doing 100KG linear leg presses! I’m very thankful to have had him as my trainer and can’t wait to continue these sessions when I’m back in Singapore in December!",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Spencer Paw,4,"I went at midnight, so there wasn't a single soul in sight, which was amazing! The washrooms need to be kept clean better though, there were used paper towels thrown on the counter and sinks, and even an empty cigarette box on the floor. The equipment is on the better-kept side, by Anytime Fitness standards.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Timothy Hoon,5,"Equipment are rather new and clean( 2 racks 1 deadlift platform 1 smith machine etc.). Tons of treadmill, have about one of each machines and similar amount of free weights as a standard AF branch.

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,jerome sim,5,The gym itself is great but why I'm writing this review is because of my experience and shocking physical progress having trained with Marlon. He's a dedicated subject matter expert who always goes the extra mile to meet my needs while pushing me to the limit. I had gained a full kilogram of muscle while losing 2% body weight in 6 weeks. The progress is crazy and I'm truly thankful to have met the fella.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,A.,2,Due to the building layout the relocated gym feels too compact and it is the worst place to be doing squats due to the uneven flooring.. The plates kept sliding off even with clips on.. that's how bad it is . You will have no center of gravity at the power racks which is dangerous.. I'm just lucky I was lifting light for that day if not I'd be severely injured,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,C Goh,1,"Quite disappointed, was a old member from plus+ times, when i rejoin, staff was very eager to e-sign me up. Kept messaging me even over the weekends.

Poor service.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Vanessa Tay,1,"The team at AF Cecil street are not helpful and are not there to help customers. As I consented to having my monthly payments be paid by Grab and due to technical issues by Grab that was of no fault of mine i.e. i fulfilled all the terms and conditions per the acknowledgement in the agreement, i wrote into AF Cecil street if they would consider waiving the late fee for this one time because it really was not anything on my part.

Without hesitation they redirect me to their payment platform EzPay to ""help with my issue"". I was to be redirected back to AF Cecil street as EzPay had mentioned that they were just ""working on behalf of the merchant and any of the changes above should be conveyed to us by the merchant and would ultimately have an effect on how your direct debits are processed."" which meant that AF Cecil street had every position and right to show good customer service to provide a one-time waiver.

However, they were so eager to earn from my late fee that they just responded with ""Hi Vanessa, we understand your frustration. As much as we want to assist you on this matter. We are unable to do it."" What kind of service is this? A gym that does not care for its patrons one bit, all it wishes to do is earn money. Not even bothering to consider the circumstances and provide some concession.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Hans Chan,5,"Perfect location convenient walk from Telok Ayer or Raffles Place MRT. I like the fact that it is within an office building so it feels more exclusive/out of sight from public.

Amenities are well equipped and I would say this is one of the top 5 in Singapore. I like that the level of crowd is quieter than the neighborhood located ones during 8-10pm timings and I hope it would stay that way.

Honestly, don't have anything to critique aside from the fact that because I'm not a home gym member here, the staff could not help me with my membership issues. But overall fantastic place to workout",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Peter Sasi,3,"Good location, modern equipment. Not the largest but okay. However several times had no soap in the dispenser in the restroom and also in the shower.

Anytime Fitness Cecil Street,Karen Cheng,1,"Tried to use the gym. After about 2 months of my last visit. Found that it is closed and in the process of moving to another location.

Called the management to check the whereabout of my stuffs - a nice pair of Nike shoes cosing more than $200, towels and small exercise accessories - in the locker. The staff was fully aware that I was storing my stuffs overnight in the locker and had even assigned the locker - one that is not a convenient location - to me. Initially Rick said that if Bernnie is aware I was using the locker to storey stuff overnight, he would have kept the stuff for me. 15 min later, he called me back and informed me they did not keep anything from the lockers and they were most probably taken by the contractors and denied defensively and rudely that it was not their fault as I should have read the notice put up on the move. I reasoned that I was not aware and could not have read the notice since I had not Bern back to the gym for weeks.

Loss of my things aside and is small matter. What annoyed me was his too-fast to deny any responsibility attitude with no apology.  As he said , if Bernnie was aware I was keeping my stuff overnight in the locker. He would have kept for me. The fact was he was aware.

I feel they had not managed the move well. Is it so difficult to keep the remaining stuffs from the lockers of their members for a few months? Upon aware of the outcome despite his earlier statement that they should be kept, he changed his stand 180 degree and pointed all his 5 fingers at me.

I think I will not be patronizing the gym anymore despite its closeness to my office.

Totally disappointed with their attitude and management.",Date not found
