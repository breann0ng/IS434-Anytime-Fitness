Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Michelle Leong,4,"A bit smaller but has everything you need for a workout.

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Tabasco Guzzler,2,"Small gym that could do much better in terms of hygiene. I was there yesterday and the condition of their toilet was poor. Smelled bad, water leakages everywhere, tissue thrown all over the place. They could use Dettol / bleach & air freshener. Staff could be more diligent in their cleaning duties.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VMRHNxTWJLNVphU1hnEAE
Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Keith Ong,4,One of the smaller AFs in the country. Enough equipment to suffice a workout. The Pros are that there are not that many people when i went which was around 4pm-6pm. People are friendly and nice. Cons are that there are many standard machines missing in this club such as Plate loaded upper body machines.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJeE9QSXRRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Jeffrey Lai,5,"Albeit one of the smaller AF gyms around, the basic equipment is more than sufficient for most gym members. Just had a consultation session with Jermyn, who was super helpful and friendly!

He took the time to know more about my daily habits and purpose of going to the gym, which led to a very insightful workout session and sharing about how to achieve my goals. I had a great time thanks to his friendly character which made the whole session comfortable and enjoyable yet intense.

Thanks Jermyn for the great experience!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT201NlJHMUlRV1ZVWVVvekxWSnJlWEZCV1VGWmFrRRAB

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,tatt low,5,Had a pleasant PT session with Coach Jermyn! He was very patient and understanding of my needs and limits and curated a personal programme with simple exercises.

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Gordon Koh,4,"This Anytime Fitness is on the smaller side, but it’s got everything you need for a solid workout. There’s a power rack, booty builder, functional area, and a nice mix of cardio machines (facing the HV food street — kind of cool view). It feels cozy and not too crowded if you go at the right time.

Staff are friendly, place is clean, and there’s even spin classes weekly. Just don’t expect big gym vibes — no deadlift platform or assisted pull-up machine here. But if you like chill, simple workouts in a convenient location, this spot does the job!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xBMVdIRm5ZMFF0WkRCdE4xaEVNV1JPV0hWaE9VRRAB

He is also knowledgable in his exercises and pushes you in a comfortable manner. I would say if you are looking to move towards your fitness goals and have the capital to do so, Jermyn is someone you can approach at this AF outlet.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GRmFHTjVWVXhtTVdWMmJrTTRibVozV0VWT05VRRAB
Anytime Fitness Holland Village,soon oh,1,"Confirm the price asking how much I need to pay today, staff mentioned just pay $89. when I went there, they asked me to pay $89 + $95 despite stating no joining fee. which they claim that $95 is access fee.

If there is access fee should state on the advertisement instead of saying no Joining fee. I don't see a different between joining fee and access fee.

Reply your comment : Since the price already given by your staff only $89 I need to pay, shouldn't you all honoured it?",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2sxS1MxRk9kVnB3TFRSS2NUWklSM1ZuYUZCbVVWRRAB
Anytime Fitness Holland Village,D T,5,"Sharing my experience with my trainer Firdaus Aziz at at Anytime Fitness Holland Village.

I’ve really appreciated my training sessions over the past 8 months with Firdaus. As a middle-aged guy who hadn’t exercised for over a decade, I was completely clueless when I first joined the gym. Thankfully, with Firdaus’s patience and friendly guidance, I gradually gained confidence and achieved both my weight loss and strength-building goals.

One aspect I truly value about Firdaus is his deep knowledge of his craft. He doesn’t just demonstrate the exercises, he takes the time to explain how and why each exercise works, in a way that’s easy for a layman like me to understand. This helped me understand how the workouts will really benefit me in the long run, beyond just going through the motions.

Firdaus also goes beyond the gym floor. His practical advice on lifestyle and nutrition encouraged me to break old habits and adopt a healthier way of living, step by step.

And to top it all off, his friendly and approachable personality makes even the most challenging sessions enjoyable - as he pushes me to go further, I always feel supported and not rushed.

If anyone in the neighbourhood is looking for a personal trainer, I highly recommend checking in with Firdaus.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwT01HZDNhRU16VkRoR1VqWXdXblpqZEdKTldrRRAB

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Vivian Han,5,"Excellent Service at Anytime Fitness Holland Village!

I had a fantastic experience with the team at Anytime Fitness Holland Village! After facing a frustrating issue with my membership cancellation at the Jurong East branch, the staff at Holland Village went above and beyond to help me resolve the situation quickly and smoothly.

They were professional, understanding, and super efficient in assisting me with the cancellation process. Unlike the poor communication I experienced at the other branch, the Holland Village team provided clear instructions and ensured everything was handled properly without any last-minute surprises.

I truly appreciate their dedication to customer service and willingness to step in and fix a problem caused by another location.

Also..allowing pet dogs in the gym is not very hygienic and I would think is against AF policy.

did a trial and got trained by one of their female trainers elvia, who is really knowledgeable and ready to spot me/correct my form with each exercise. she was able to customize a workout for me based on what i wanted to train, and gave me advice on supplements and pre-workouts.

This is my second time visiting and if I did not live so far from here, I'd definitely come here more often.

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Malcolm Chew,5,"Been working out for about 3 months with the outlet's Head Coach, Claira. And through my time training with her, I've made significant progress working towards my fitness goals. She's professional, knowledgeable, adaptable and most importantly a very understanding trainer that knows the difficulties of working on your personal goals. Training & Nutrition has been really tailored to the specific goals that I was working on, and she's creative to switch up things along the weeks to spice things up so it won't be repetitive/boring/routine based. Much effort and dedication are put into the work she does, evidently seen through her actions.

Outlet review:
It's a cozy and nice outlet, crowd is quite okay. Has sufficient equipment enough to do all your exercises. Has a good range of light-Medium, semi advanced weight range. Would recommend if your level of exercising is between beginner/Intermediate/slightly advance.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtb29XVDVnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Holland Village,Parry,1,"If you’re seeing this, take it as a sign to not sign up with holland AF. Scam company that lies to customers and will not honour promotion (yes even if you sign). So please, I implore you, think twice

The 5 star reviews below are probably for members whose contract have not lapsed yet.

But please refrain from signing up with holland AF.

Basically when I signed up, was promised 2 free months if I paid upfront for 1.5 years. Sounds like a great deal, I signed and paid, took picture of the contract and got WhatsApp confirmation from the staff. Months later I broke my arm as well, and got confirmation that my membership has been paused for 4 months.

Long story short these months that were promised to me were not logged into the system.

Whatsapped them but they did not even want to send me the original contract I signed with them. Suspicious right? Kept saying that I’m no longer in their gym and transferred elsewhere so they don’t have access to any of my info. Rlly?? I doubt that all history of members are erased just like that.

I hope that more investigation can be done on this matter and if not, I hope that this review can prevent someone else from falling for such cheap tricks.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5MXAtcm9BRRAB
