Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,fabius lee,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I recently joined the Anytime Fitness gym in Potong Pasir, and I couldn't be happier with my experience! From the moment I walked in, the friendly staff (Khairul, KS and Joan) greeted me with warm smiles that instantly made me feel at home. They are always ready to help, whether it’s showing me how to use the equipment or offering workout tips.

The gym itself is well-maintained, with a great variety of machines and free weights. Plus, the atmosphere is so positive—it’s motivating to be around other members who share the same fitness goals. I love the convenience of 24/7 access, allowing me to work out whenever it suits my schedule.

If you're looking for a welcoming fitness community, this is the place to be! Highly recommend Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir for anyone wanting to get fit while enjoying a friendly vibe. 😊🏋️‍♀️",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfbk16a2h3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Vincent Pang,4,"ANYTIME FITNESS Potong Pasir: A Solid Choice with Room for Improvement

ANYTIME FITNESS Potong Pasir offers a convenient location and a well-equipped facility. The 24/7 access is a significant perk, allowing for flexible workout schedules. The gym is generally clean and well-maintained, thanks to the diligent cleaning staff.

The staff are friendly and helpful, providing assistance when needed. However, the atmosphere could be enhanced with better music distribution, especially on the ground floor.
The free WiFi is a nice touch, but the outdated hotspot model can be frustrating. Upgrading to a regular WiFi setup with secure WEP access would significantly improve the user experience.

While the gym is accessible, the lack of a covered walkway can be a bit inconvenient on rainy days, particularly for those who park further away.

Additionally, the ground floor can get quite warm in the afternoons, especially when the sun is shining.

A few suggestions to improve the gym experience:
* Install cubbies on the ground floor: This would be convenient for members who prefer to store their belongings on the ground floor.

* Install heat film on the ground floor: This would help regulate the temperature and create a more comfortable workout environment.

* Implement stricter rules against hogging machines: Clear signage or verbal reminders could discourage members from monopolizing equipment.

* Upgrade the WiFi system: A more user-friendly WiFi system would enhance the overall gym experience.

Overall, ANYTIME FITNESS Potong Pasir is a solid choice for those seeking a well-equipped gym with flexible hours. With a few minor improvements, it could become an even more enjoyable workout destination.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2NE1XbS1BRRAB
Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Lucien Lim,5,"A well maintained and clean gym fit with all the necessary equipment. The gym is very spacious, spanning across two floors, with the second holding an expansive activity studio.

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Rizaldy Yudhista,5,"I've been a member of Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir for more than a year now, and it's been an amazing experience! The staff here are always friendly, approachable, and ready to assist whenever needed. The gym is well-equipped with a full range of machines and free weights, all of which are consistently well-maintained and clean.

The atmosphere is great but it can be pretty crowded some time, just pick the time suitable for you as this gym is open 24/7. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned gym-goer, this place has everything you need. I've been in several AF, so far, this is the best so far, it has all my exercise needs.

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Ling kang Ong,5,"Toilet facilities are always clean. Equipments are new and well maintained. There is a good selection of music and beats. Notwithstanding, the second floor section allows for more privacy and quiet. It’s also very well located - about 50ms from the met.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VLVC10UGFNNk5Hd1BnEAE
Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Sihan Goi,3,"Came for a morning workout at around 730am on a Wednesday, and it was still quite empty, but got busy around an hour later. All the racks and platforms were used by then.

Equipment is quite ok, and is spread across 2 levels. Majority are on the ground floor, with 2 full power racks with attached platforms, both kg and lb bumper plates, rubberised plates, Lifefitness plate loaded machines, benches and cable machines, dumbbells up to 50kg, fixed bars, cardio equipment, etc.

Specs wise, it's pretty decent, but I have some gripes. Firstly, despite having some Rogue bars (both kg and lbs), none of the bars spin properly. Also, while there are both kg and lb bumper plates (Hammer Strength kg and Rogue lb plates), there aren't enough to support 2 racks and 2 platforms. There was only 1 set of 10-25kg plates, and 1+ set of 10-55 lb plates. Also, the floor around the racks/platforms was damp. It seems water has seeped into the rubber flooring. You can't tell from just looking at it, but once you step on it, you can see wet imprints of your shoes/feet. I wore my socks without shoes while warming up and wet it while walking around the platforms. Because of this, I had to wear my shoes later on without socks.

Another gripe is that the racks are quite short, and the J hooks can only be used internally and doesn't extend out to the platform. Because if this, if you're tall, good luck pressing inside the rack - you'll likely hit the top. The intervals between J hook positions are also fairly wide, so you may end up in a case where 1 position is too high, and the next one is too low.

Lastly, while the aircon was on and the temperature wasn't that high, I was sweating buckets due to lack of circulation. The fans were not sufficient IMHO as they didn't reach the corner racks/platforms. I don't have this problem at other AF.

There is a studio on level 2 as well as some miscellaneous equipment that seems to be haphazardly placed there.

Facilities wise, the are restrooms, 2 shower rooms with both shampoo and body wash, lockers, and open pigeon holes. These are all unisex.

Parking is very limited around the gym, I was lucky to find a lot further way since I was early, but good luck if you're not.

This gym has the potential to be 4 stars or more if the above are fixed.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyN2JERjJBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Tydir W,5,"Will update review once I’ve tried the strength training equipment, but it looks well maintained. Good range of equipment.

Outlet is split into two levels, first level is a bit small and may feel cramped at peak hours. Air freshener smell is a bit strong in some areas though.

2nd level has (as of june’23) a small room with some stationary bikes (upright and recumbent), and a rowing machine, and some miscellaneous equipment.

The studio space is HUGE though, and the gym touts a range of classes I didn’t get to see a schedule for. But the upper level is very good and it’s probably the biggest studio space I’ve seen out of any of the AFs. Can easily accommodate classes and still have people doing their own stretches and exercises.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKMmVLZzh3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Lirene Bay,5,"I've been to many AF, but none have made me feel as at home as this one. The crews are incredibly friendly and always go above and beyond to make sure everyone feels comfortable. The equipment is well-maintained, and I recently noticed they went through a de-rusting process, which shows their dedication to upkeep.

One thing I really appreciate is how they take feedback seriously. For example, they adjusted the aircon temperature for yoga classes so it's not too cold, and for Body Combat classes so it's not too warm. This attention really sets them apart.

They also added a mop after we mentioned the need to wipe our sweat on the floor, which has made a big difference in preventing it from being slippery. It's these little things that make me feel truly appreciated as a member.

The gym offers a great variety of machines and classes, from yoga to Les Mills BodyCombat and Body Pump. I highly recommend this gym to anyone looking for a welcoming environment and a well-rounded fitness experience.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5N01yLUVnEAE

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Cassie Yu,1,"#Proceed with Caution Before Signing Up Because You DON’T Know What You Signed Up For#

I recently had a very frustrating experience with anytime fitness Potong Pasir regarding their membership cancellation policy, and I feel compelled to share my story to help others make an informed decision.

I signed up for a membership with them on July 2024, but due to a neurological condition, I am currently under medical care and taking prescribed medication. On 25 Feb, my doctor provided me with a referral letter to a neurologist to take further examination on my disease. On 4 Mar, I have submitted that to request a cancellation of my membership, on 5 Mar I submitted another medical certificate clearly stating that I am unable to exercise for two weeks until further review, following the terms outlined in the contract.

To my surprise, they rejected my cancellation request. Their reasoning was that my membership minimum term ends in 2026, and the medical documents only state that I am unable to exercise for two weeks, which they claim is insufficient for a ""Premature Cancellation."" However, the contract does not specify any required duration for being unable to exercise to qualify for cancellation. I have asked to clarify their decision and provide a valid explanation, but I have yet to receive a response.

This lack of transparency and unwillingness to accommodate a legitimate medical condition is extremely frustrating and disappointing. I urge anyone considering signing up for a membership with Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir to carefully review their cancellation policy and think twice before committing, especially if you have any health concerns or relocation concerns.

I hope they will reconsider their stance and provide better support for their members in the future. Until then, I cannot recommend this gym in good conscience.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNReVotQ2tBRRAB

2. The evening sessions, especially Yoga are very good. Patrick and Gwen are helpful instructors
3. The location: 5 mins walk from MRT

What is missing:
1. The ventilation: the ventilation in the weights area is super bad. You can not make the best out of the money you pay for trainer session as you are under performing due to the sheer heat and lack of air in that area. I have had blackouts many times due this issue.
2. Changing area: there are constant issues with the changing areas- water cooler not working ( no cold water), bad odour from the washrooms and not so clean locker room floors are unresolved issues.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiM00yT3BnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Elaine T,1,"My husband and I signed up for trial at two Anytime Fitness gyms, including AF Potong Pasir. These two gyms were the closest to our house.

When the club inquired, I was transparent with them that we needed to check out both locations before making a decision. As with any trial, this includes finding out the gym facilities and packages they have to offer. I presumed each gym's facilities and pricing would be different as they are independently owned.

Initially there were a lot of questions from AF Potong Pasir over text and uncertainty on their end about what to do, but they eventually rescinded the free trial and offered me a club tour instead.

In the same message, I was accused of ""club-hopping without intention of signing up a membership"". In their words, ""This could be classified as an abuse to our system as you are utilising the free trials across multiple clubs with no definite intention to sign a membership package.""

When I reiterated my intentions to them and explained the misunderstanding on their part, there was no apology from them at all and they only talked about their policies. They could have contacted me by phone call if they needed to clarify further, but they did not do so.

As customers who were ready to sign up for a new gym membership, this was downright insulting and embarrassing to say the least. To us, this is a red flag in terms of their management.

First of all, if a customer is not allowed to sign up for trial at more than one location, this should have been stated clearly on the website. If I had known, I would have only signed up for trial at one location and saved myself from being disrespected this way.

Secondly, I understand that every company has to adhere to their own terms and conditions. If you have to withdraw your free trial, that is totally fine - but at least be courteous when you are informing the person, instead of accusing them of abusing the system.

The free trial is not important here; it is their customer service or the lack thereof that is alarming. A blessing in disguise that we realised this before signing up as members at this location.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqdThuRzZnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Tian Jia Teo,1,"This is my first time to encounter a very bad staff service. All the while I always made payment on time, but only this recent month, I was suddenly informed that my bank’s auto-deduct payment was unsuccessful due to insufficient amount, and because of that, they charged me extra SGD 15.26 as a penalty. I checked my bank and found that it’s not because of an insufficient issue..but instead some bank setting matter. I asked the gym representative to refund me the penalty fee as it’s  not my fault but he ignored my concerns. As we all know, bank system issues are sometimes inevitable, I think anytime fitness should provide a buffer time for us to react to this kind of matter, eg when we facing card problems, bank problem, system problems etc. before charging us penalty immediately.

Even when they informed me, they just whatapps me without giving a call to clarify about the issue.

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Claire Chen,5,"YJ has initiated to examine my body index at Toa Payoh Anytime on July 1, after his detailed and professional analysis I decided to purchase his personal coaching classes on the spot and started my first class in the same day. I have followed him to Wheelock AF and Potong Pasir AF for the rest of 4 coaching sessions and I really enjoyed every single class with him. He is super professional, punctual and patient (especially today I finally learned to move my back muscles after his patient and detailed guidance and adjustment). I understand both English and Chinese but he still coached me with my native tongue Chinese. His dedication and professionalism deserves applause and more exposure to other beginners (and intermediate gym-goers as well). I highly recommend YJ to everyone that I know! Well done and genuinely wish you continued success in your profession, YJ. 👍👍👍👍👍",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURid2N6R2h3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Potong Pasir,Elisabeth Lee,2,"Cleaningness is bad. Smell urine in bathroom in the morning and filth on floors in the purple area. Ongoing problem which Management seem can’t get a hold of.

I pay 118 per month but there are cheaper prices depending on package and promotion that can make this place feel a little more worthwhile.

Crowded but there are off peak hours like 10am that if you can make it, it becomes a good gym. Space is a known problem and can’t do that much about. They did improve in spacing of the equipment, though; and brought more good additions.

Small annoyances such as asked for quite a long time for a pair of ankle strap which I assume is cheap and no response and can’t seem to have them get a pair which makes per leg glutes workout that much slower... (yes, I know, a more female concern!)

Otherwise for a quick in-and-out gym it’s good. There is a lack of good gym around here... Low mark mainly is because this gym doesn’t seem reactive and not being managed as tightly as it could such as with cleanliness and get straps!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRNFlmWExBEAE

Why is there prejudice against bodybuilders we pay our monthly fees as well and we cannot even make noise when we are lifting heavy ? We did not slam any weights both dumbbells and barbells alike. To make things worst the music there was so soft that my friend and I had to put on our own earpieces to train.

Literally doesn't make sense at all... might as well put up a sign and say that this is a library and no intense training or bodybuilders allowed.
