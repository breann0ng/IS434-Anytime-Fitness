Anytime Fitness Kaki Bukit,Muhd Haarith,5,"Incredibly convenient and well-maintained. The equipment is modern and covers all the essentials—from free weights and resistance machines to a decent range of cardio options. It’s never too crowded, which means no long waits to use the machines.

The staff is friendly (especially Mus) and helpful, and the overall atmosphere is welcoming, especially for beginners or those who prefer a quieter workout environment.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VPemtpNWpRc09QNjZRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kaki Bukit,Hareef __,5,"AF Kaki Bukit is conviniently located near my house. The equipments are new and sufficient for my workouts. The gym is neat and clean, and the trainers are very friendly and helpful. It may not be a big gym but it is enough to get your fix in. Highly recommended if you are nearby and need that sweat! 💪 …",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJU3UyNk90Z3ZmQUZ3EAE
Anytime Fitness Kaki Bukit,Aniq Syukri,4,Pretty well rounded I would say but it would be a 5 star for me if they could substitute some machines such as the plate loaded chest press to a plate loaded t-bar row or some sort. Maybe consider separating the leg curl and leg extension to 2 different machines instead of a convertable for ergonomics purposes and also a standing calf raise machine. Overall Good place to get a sweat in and staff are really engaging to their members.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VQRGVwYldkem9LNXJRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kaki Bukit,Hamada Masahiro,5,"Quite a small AF outlet. Went in the morning when there weren't alot of people. They had 2 main squat racks and a smith plus some other machines.

Good enough machine variety to have a full workout for push or pull splits.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VPX1AzNUtZX05yUDZ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Kaki Bukit,YC Ang,1,"Thought I’d drop by to try this new gym omw home and see if it can be my new home gym. Unfortunately, it is not cyclist / trifold bicycle friendly at all. I was asked to lock my folded bicycle outside while there is no secured bicycle parking rails, after asking politely if there’s any space to put it inside. It seems to me either this gym’s crews don’t care about members’ properties or they have no two cents about how rampant expensive bicycle parts are getting stolen when locked unsupervised outside.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xseWIzUTJXVE16WVRnM1NHNXRWbnBhV2w4dFdIYxAB
