Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Desmond Peh,1,"I was promised that this is a vibrant and safe place for gym-goers when I signed up. However, my experience proved it otherwise within a short span of time.

For two consecutive weeks, I was harassed by a member of this particular outlet whom I am totally stranger with. A Terry-ble person who aims to Terry-orise people around him. He is short, plump, slightly bald and speaks in a demanding tone, expecting you to comply as he corrects your posture and use of equipment when he could not even do a proper rep for all his exercises. On every occasion, I brought up this act of harassment to the management but they claimed that they had spoken to him about it. Talk is cheap when there is no improvement at all, this left a very bad taste and it proves to me that it is not safe for me to patronise this outlet anymore.

I was told by the management that the members were loud and this equates to a vibrant environment. There is a huge difference between vibrant and loud, and many gym-goers want a quiet environment to work out.

It is truly disappointing and unsettling. I hope that no one else will go through such an ordeal.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWR1UwTk5hVTlSVFRkM09VUjZYMFJaUkRWTU5IYxAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,twshady,5,"This gym is a great place! Staff are attentive and always open to feedback for improvement.

On a side note, unfortunately, I recently ran into a truly inconsiderate gym user named Desmond Peh. He and his Boyfriend... were lifting light weights but kept slamming them down, then leaving the equipment behind for others to put away for them. Basic courtesy and gym etiquette seemed completely lost on them. If you can’t handle the weights, don’t touch them. Go lighter if it's too heavy for you.

So I told this Desmond guy as he did not rack his weights after using them. If this is considered as ""harassment"" then maybe the coffeeshop aunties are also ""harassing"" you when they ask you to return your plates. Common sense and basic courtesy shouldn't be that hard.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21FMWNuVnFkVVJ2ZEc4d1EzTTNXVE5sWVV0NmVYYxAB

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Gokila Vani,5,"Friendly staffs. Quick response to enquiries. 3 levels where heavy exercises done at basement, classes and personal training at level 2. Level 1 is generic. Equipments are clean and well maintained. Started immediately once the payment was completed. Affordable price. Love visiting this gym everyday!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlaElQVnlRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Boom Boom,1,"I wouldn’t recommend Anytime Fitness to anyone. Joining is effortless, but leaving? That’s a whole different story. They don’t let you cancel easily—you have to email them after your contract ends, and if anything goes wrong with that email, you’re forced to keep paying. On top of that, they require a 30-day notice, which is just ridiculous. Why make it so difficult for people to leave?

The gym itself isn’t worth the stress. It’s a lot of money per month, yet the service is disappointing. The staff aren’t helpful, and I’ve seen complaints about rude behaviour. A gym should be welcoming, not frustrating.

If you’re considering joining, think twice. Getting in is easy, but getting out feels like a trap.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBclpqMTl3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,ease breeze,1,"wore covered shoes, long pants and long sleeve shirt but the guy said what i was wearing was in ""inappropriate"". If so why didnt say it at the start, why stop me halfway thru my set, and could have atleast say it nicely. oh wells

He couldnt even pin point what was wrong with my outfit when i asked. i believe what was more inappropriate is that he was vaping outside. Seems like a very appropriate thing to do.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tzMlZFcExTaTFPUjNOU2FVbElkM1pUWTNCZlZuYxAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Kannina,2,"Out of all the AF I've been to, probably the one with the oldest equipment e.g. bumper plates and racks. The racks are so unclean that there's dust bunnies in them. The bumper plates fit very awkwardly on the racks. It just underwent a renovation not long ago but my main gripe is the lack of proper sanitizers. Before the reno at least you had disposable wipes. Now it's just a sad smelly cloth for each level with a spray that looks like it's holding some watered down Dettol. It's definitely not the worst. You can still do your workouts just alright. 2 squat racks, 1 deadlift platform, a bunch of machines, and a spacious functional area on the 2nd floor.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGNmFpSGdBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Jayvinn Wong,4,"Great gym! Good range of equipment which are well spaced out across 3 floors. Aircon was working well with good ventilation and pleasant environment.

However, noticed many machines with weights left on by users.

Notable equipment:
Half rack with deadlift platform
Full rack
Smith Machine
Plate loaded leg press
Isolatetal chest and back machine
Calf raise machine
Sit up bench",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKdGRXY3FRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Muhammad Zafir,5,"The gym facility is excellent, offering a wide range of equipment for all fitness levels. The machines are well-maintained, and there's a great variety of free weights, cardio machines, and functional training areas. The space is clean, well-organized, and never overcrowded, making it easy to get a great workout. Overall, this gym provides a comfortable and motivating environment for anyone looking to improve their fitness.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfeUxlTVlBEAE
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,黄文忠,1,"Worst gym experience ever. I went to check out the place before signing up, and the staff barely paid attention to me. They seemed uninterested and acted like they were doing me a favour by answering my questions. That should have been my first red flag.

I still decided to join, thinking maybe the facilities would make up for it. Big mistake. The equipment is always occupied, and some machines are either broken or not well-maintained. The worst part? The cancellation process. It’s not straightforward at all. You have to email them after your contract ends, and if anything goes wrong, you’re charged again. Plus, they require one month’s notice. It just feels like they’re making it as difficult as possible to leave.

At almost $100 per month, I expected way better. The staff are unprofessional, the gym is overcrowded, and the whole experience is just frustrating. Definitely not worth it.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcmJUUXNBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Pei Gen Koh,5,Clean and reliable gym that’s in a great location for me.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s0MFoyRmhSMU4xZUV3NVJuaEdURmRLZDNJdFpGRRAB
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,Romee TuTu,1,"While registration is easy, cancelling the membership is a nightmare. They require members to send an email after the expiry date, which is unnecessarily troublesome. If they don’t receive the email (or claim not to), you’re automatically charged for another month—$99, no less! They also have a ridiculous 30-day notice period for cancellations. Why make it so hard for members to leave?

For a gym charging this much, the service should at least be decent. Instead, the staff are unprofessional, as seen in other Google reviews where someone was body-shamed. This is unacceptable. If I wanted to donate money, I’d give it to charity, not to a gym that lacks basic accountability.

Avoid this place unless you enjoy unnecessary fees and poor service.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcmVqY1h3EAE
Anytime Fitness Choa Chu Kang,chen rui ying,1,"Not happy with this place at all. Signing up was easy, but cancelling was such a hassle. They said I had to email them after my contract ended, and if they didn’t get the email, I’d have to keep paying. On top of that, I had to give one month’s notice before cancelling. Why make it so hard?

The gym costs $90++ per month, but the service is terrible. The staff are very unprofessional. The way they talk to customers makes me wonder if they have any proper training at all.

Honestly, this place is not worth the money or the trouble.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcllpX3FRRRAB
