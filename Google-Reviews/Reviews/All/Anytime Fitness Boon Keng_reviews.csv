Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,Vanessa Tan,5,"New, clean, spacious, double storied gym! It was spacious enough to not feel like i was in the way but also noted that I was there during nonpeak hours.

I tried their 90 min free trial but the manager was really nice to allow me to stay longer because it was raining cats and dogs outside! It was easy to sign up, I simply dropped them a whatsapp a day before. Trial hours were limited from Monday to Friday 1pm to 7pm (last session at 5.30pm)

I forgot to take photos of the upstairs but there was a stretching area and space for free weights with 4 barbells.

What I really appreciated was a female only toilet! Im considering signing up. Prices were quite pricey now as compared to what I was expecting or have been hearing before where they could be less than $100 per month if you signed for longer. Currently as they stand, what I understand:

1 month - $158
6 months - $138
12 months - $118
18 months - $108",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURENHV5MjhnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,Akhil Murali,5,"Amirul is an outstanding manager at Anytime Fitness. He’s not only professional and efficient in running the gym, but also incredibly friendly and approachable. He always takes time to listen to members, helps solve issues quickly, and creates a welcoming atmosphere for everyone. As a friend and as a manager, Amirul genuinely cares about people and it shows in the way the gym is run. Highly recommended!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRd3F2ZGlBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,Elena Ng,5,"Was here for my 90min free trial on a weekday lunchtime slot.

The gym was quite empty, and really spacious! Some AFs can be super tight in how they place their equipment but I really appreciated how well spread out this one was. Well lit too.

Loved the fact that they had 3 squat racks. Plates were a little weathered but barbell was really clean and platforms were very new.

Didn’t see any cloths and spray bottles for wipe downs but cleaner was very conscientious with cleaning the area and equipment.

Had a great workout, and hope they have promos soon so I can make my visits here more regular.

Shout out to the manager Amirul who managed my online enquiry and showed me around at the gym. Really cheerful and friendly both online and in person. Much appreciated when embarking on a new fitness journey.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREXzlMWWpnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,Tabasco Guzzler,5,Decent 2-storey gym with essential weight training equipment & clean bathrooms on both levels. Surprisingly large upper floor with a generous area for stretching. Gym users are respectful & mature. 1 star short of a perfect rating as counter staff could be friendlier & more helpful.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOcEx2RlVBEAE
Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,md “the destroyer” rafiq,4,"Location is an A+ as it's walking distance to Bendemeer MRT with the only slight inconvenience being the sometimes long wait at the traffic light.

For general health and fitness it is perfect, with cardio marchines and free weights all being abundant and perfectly serviceable. The racks and  benches are also of good quality, and the dumbbells go up from 2.5kg all the way to almost 50, which is a big plus. Additionally, they have ladies' olympic barbells (15kg/smaller diameter) available for use. They also have shower and washrooms on both floors, and there is rarely a wait for them.

Minor gripes that led to 4 instead of 5 stars are that the barbells chosen are Ziva and not of the best quality in terms of knurling for strength training, and that there are only two barbells with center knurling (important for movements where the barbell sits on the back). Additionally, chalk is not allowed. One point to note is that since the platforms are on the second floor, use of additional rubber mats are required if lifters intend to drop or slam the bumper plates, though this is hardly the fault of the gym

These are very minor complaints though, and AF boon keng easily sits at the top of the rankings for AF gyms in Singapore",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURQeElyNmhBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,RyptRin,5,"Seriously one of the better Anytime Fitness out there. Been going to this franchise gym for 3 years now, and this particular location has the best layout ever. Equipments are relatively newer, rust-free, and has the deadlift platforms I need, and it even have a trap bar, which is a rare sight. The 2 level gym located in a shophouse provides enough space in between equipments, and even have a separate space just for classes, which is also a rare find among anytime fitness gyms.

Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,Weng Yue Siew,4,"The gym is located on Second and Third floor, which is fine. Adequate equipment.

Things which are good:
- squat rack area has good space around to allow free movement
- relatively high ceiling (low ceilings make exercise claustrophobic)
-  dumbbells are arranged in order, making searching for the intended weight easier. Some gyms do not practice this, and you sometimes spend time looking for the weight you want.
- equipment seems well maintained (at least for the ones I use)

Only wish to point out reason for having one star less.
-The ventilation does not seem like those which incorporates fresh air. The ACs are split units meaning its recirculated air. Even if there is fresh air, it seems minimal. As such, the air freshener smell in the gym is very overpowering.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLMWFDSkl3EAE

Anytime Fitness Boon Keng,Dave Kin,5,"Good gym for travelers, a little pricey, not very crowded and OCD levels of clean.

Overall they offer a 1 month membership for slightly over 200 or 30 dollars per entry if you prefer not to have to fill up excessive forms or credit card details.

There aren't any duplicate equipment except for cardio machines, and has almost everything a standard US planet fitness would have (precor machines). Not the best equipped for advanced gym goers but more than sufficient for travelers imo.

No towel service, but they do sell towels, pre-workout and shakes on their machine. It would be a problem as the machine does not accept cash. But at least it's both Apple pay and Google pay compatible.

The cleaning crew patrols the place like a hawk. U can see them walking in circles cleaning the place without rest. Great shower and bathroom facilities. And they clean each one almost after every single use it seems. Can be said to be even better than most hotels.

Was a little harder to judge the place due to a lack of reviews and photos. Overall it's a really really small gym located on the second and third floors. With cardio on the 2nd, together with the typical all around full body routine for a simple 30 minute workout. Weights are on the 3rd floor together with some open space for those in body weight exercises. They even have gymnastics rings.

Great for gym addicts who stay in the nearby hotels and hostels",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNncjZhRHJnRRAB
