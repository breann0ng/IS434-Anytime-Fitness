Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Dex X,5,"Very friendly staff and clean facilities! I dropped by for a workout in the afternoon, and the equipment was well-maintained with no wait time. The environment felt safe, and the team there was welcoming and helpful without being intrusive.

Pros:
• Clean and modern gym setup
• Staff are friendly and always willing to assist
• Convenient location inside Wheelock Place",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21acFRtMWFOVVJSY0RFNWNYWldabXQzYjE4eGVGRRAB
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Justin Hoyo,4,"Awesome gym here in town! This gym is well-equipped, well maintained, clean, and the staff are very friendly. There’s a very big room for classes (which I don’t go to, but some may enjoy it) - I’d prefer if there was a larger weight area and shrink the size of the room.

The only downside of this gym is that there are not enough weight plates, I’ll often find myself looking around for plates during my workout. But overall, still an amazing gym!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUN3N0tiTXdBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Satorufly,5,"I’ve been a member at Anytime Fitness Wheelock for a while now, and I just have to say the staff here are truly outstanding. From the moment you step in, you’re greeted with genuine warmth and friendliness , it really makes the gym feel like a welcoming space, not just a place to work out.

They’re always ready to help, whether it’s showing you how to use equipment properly, sharing training tips, or just checking in to see how your fitness journey is going. You can tell they genuinely care about members’ well-being and progress. The positive energy they bring makes training here so much more enjoyable and motivating.

Thank you to the whole team for creating such a clean, safe, and encouraging environment, you’ve made Anytime Fitness Wheelock feel like a second home for me.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pGNVRHOUtOazlIUldWMWMyWXpWbTVmYWkwM1FYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Sin Yee Lau,5,"Location is quite convenient—right next to the MRT exit and well connected to various malls.

The staff are always friendly, prompt to answer my queries, and welcoming despite not being their gym member.

What really stands out are the group classes—they’re not just fun, but also challenging in the best way. The trainers know their stuff and know how to push you while still keeping things engaging! The studio is pretty big and well maintained. But perhaps can have more fans or aircon inside haha",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvMHF6YVBnEAE
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Wengheng Chan,5,"Hands down the best AF branch so far.
Pros:
- Great location. Feels atas. Orchard mrt just below.
- Damn helpful and friendly staff , no pushing of PT sessions. Always feel welcome  whenever i go there.
- Big classroom . I need that for my stretching, warmups and sit ups and evening classes
- sizeable shower rooms available , though toilet is outside AF, the public toilets are clean as seldom any crowd at that floor.
- air con is strong.

Cons
- evening crowds but understandable
- can get rather rowdy as international high school students crowd the gym and hog machines in groups.
- and i havent seen them wiping down the equipments after use.
- staff shld check the level of spray bottles periodically as some of them are empty.
- classes only available on weekdays.
- lack of quantity and variety of detachable bars for cable exercises.
- payment provider Ezypay is sneaky and problematic. There are times where payment was claimed to be “ blocked” by my bank but my bank denies that and i got charged penalty of $15 by Ezypay. I have to work around it by paying over the counter earlier than the payment date. AF staff also can provide me with a QR code over whatsapp too.

But for the price point, they still deserve a 5 star.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tFMmVEbGtiMTlPZHpWblNEQjNOVWcxTTNjd1kxRRAB

Their music choice is out of the ordinary gym music (high energy and loud), more relaxing spa vibe going on here 😅

They got all the essential equipment and good for all kinds of workouts!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOMHVmNU13EAE
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Jeremy Chan,5,"This AF is actually pretty close to my home but this is the 1st time I’ve been to the gym & honestly, it’s definitely ranked in my top 3 AF gyms in SG. They’ve got tons of equipment, definitely sufficient enough for a fruitful workout. The atmosphere is great, the clientele seem pretty cordial, & even during the peak hours, even though it can get more packed than usual, it’s still big enough to not feel claustrophobic in any way.

AF City Hall is still closer to me, but this AF is definitely a gym good enough for my workouts. I will definitely be frequenting this gym more often from now on. 5 outta 5 stars.

P.S. 3 months since I wrote the review up there and I have to say this is now my favourite AF gym in the entire SG.

Friendliest staff and patronising members, and even when it’s really packed you’d always be able to finish your workout, even if that’s sharing equipment with other members.

In conclusion, if I could give them 6 out of 5 stars, an extra star, I would. Lol.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUai12YkFnEAE

Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Hans Evans,1,"The Gym has a bad habit of turning off their aircon after 11pm. Gym has a musky smell because of this and is really hot. Because of the hot air, it creates a really moist environment and not conducive for working out. Not sure why they pivoted to turning off the aircons when they were doing great back then. Saving cost is all I can think of at this point",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25OVWVVRkNhemRuTVU1bk1XaHpUSEp2V0c5ck1uYxAB

Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Juztin Png,5,"First time coming to this Anytime Fitness branch today.
And I must say I'm very impressed 👍

The gym is super neat and clean.
All cardio machines and weights are in tiptop condition and all are working properly. Aircon and ventilation is great, had my one hrs of treadmill run done comfortably.

The Shower room is another place where this gym impress me. Simple and clean design and they manage to keep it spotless clean. This is good effort

The staff is fantastic!
If I remember their name correctly, they are Gary, Khai and Toby (Pardon me if I didn't catch your name right), they are awesome!
Very friendly and nice.
When I step into the gym, they already welcome me with a nice warm smile and greeting. Thanks for the great service and being so welcoming.

Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Cyrus Koshi Chung,4,"I love the gym environment and equipment, its clean and they have sufficient equipment for different muscle groups training.

I minus One Star becoz of one of ur staff.. I get it that he is just working staff and doing his job addressing his concerns about training buddy. Truly understand and not feeling offended at all..

I assured him about his concerns but actually what disappointed me was he just ignore and say he has the right to reject us and his tone is unfriendly to be honest.

Later after that from what i saw, actually he can smile to his colleague and greet the visiting celebrities so why not the members?

Luckily when i leave, one of your other staff is nice and friendly enough to greet. So its only that particular person.

End of the day, it still benefits ur club if your staff could build a good relationship with the members.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyaWYzcHhRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Randy Sugianto 「Yuku」,1,"I was charged a $15.26 late fee simply because my credit card failed once—without any prior warning or reminder. There was no message like, “Your payment failed, please update your details before [XX May 2025].” Instead, the late fee was applied immediately and without notice.

When I raised the issue, AF deflected responsibility, saying the fee was charged by Ezypay. Technically, yes, I did sign an agreement that allows for this fee. So legally, they’re in the clear. But ethically and professionally? I find it poor practice. A failed card charge should not cost $15.26—processing a failed transaction likely costs less than 10 cents, if anything at all.

It feels unfair and unnecessarily punitive. Businesses should act in good faith, and that includes sending a simple heads-up before charging fees.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZcXRhbkhREAE

Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,The InvisibleGaijin,5,"Might be one of the best AF gym experiences I've had so far. Why it's one of my favourites:
1) Centrally located
2) smells good, good choice of air freshener
3) spacious enough for a good variety of machines
4) pleasant music for a change! No loud electronic/hardstyle music. Very peaceful.
5) because it's new, it's really clean.
6) I like how they've a lateral raise machine.

Here comes the downside, but I'll still decide to give 5 stars anyway:
1) I really wished there was an incline chest press machine instead of a decline one. I believe many people would like to train the upper chest, which is normally less developed. Dumbbells on incline bench are great but having machine stability allows me to focus on engaging the upper pecs better.
2) same for squats, would be great if there was a hack squat machine.

Overall, still a great place to get a good workout.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNseTQyWW9RRRAB

2. More hanging bar in the shower room.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeEw3OEdBEAE
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Justin Goff,5,"This gym is almost perfect. Almost

In my own humble opinion it lacks just a tad bit of other stuffs to make this gym the best there is island wide.

What I noticed is that it does not have a T-bar or maybe even a landmine style for some traditional back training. Olympic hex bar for some wicked pump. Sissy squat for some killer leg finisher. Curved cable pulldown bar/s to relieve some tension on the wrist.

Other than that, everything is perfect. I’m genuinely impressed with this location.

There’s a gym back home called planet fitness and guh that place is just 😵‍💫 and somehow while visiting AF around the globe, one thing I noticed and to be honest it stands out every time I walk in is that it has too many signs. Far too many signs and even threats of penalty if you do not re-rack the free weights you used🤡

This gym in particular signifies that it’s a no brainer. You used it, put it back. If for some reason that you couldn’t, well fukk it we have some club associates that tends to the gym anyway but clearly don’t abuse it. Correct? Now that’s a gym for me.

Anyway, aside from all the praise I said and with some of what this location lacks, I’d like to add the idea of perhaps leaving the AC remote hanged so that the club members can adjust the AC or even turn it on because I noticed during midnight it’s just off.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR6NE5iTWxRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,David Kim,4,"Please help consider putting small wooden rectangle chairs into each shower booth similar to other centres’ ones. I need the space to arrange my belongings before and after taking a shower. And currently, changing socks while standing on the wet floor is slightly not comfortable, to be honest.
Also, it will be appreciated if you install the disposable sanitation wipes.
One more thing, pasting some guides for restroom location, and the path for way in and out from AF bef/aft opening hours of Wheelock Place will also be helpful. Thank you.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURGdDhuSE9nEAE
Anytime Fitness Wheelock Place,Joyce Yong,1,"My son was misled into signing his first ever gym membership with AF Wheelock Place. He is enlisting into National Service in Feb 2024 and thought of doing gym training while waiting for enlistment.  The staff on site told him he could use the gym for one year and run through an electronic document, telling him to fill in his names in the blanks, and then told him he could use.  The staff didn't explain the implications that he cannot back out.  The cancellation clause only applies to medical conditions and relocation. He is a student; how can he relocate on his own? He has no working income to begin with.  We appealed to AF Wheelock Place but the club supervisor refused my son's request.  He signed up on Friday 24 Nov 2023 and after we found out the misleading sign-up, we called on Tuesday 28 Nov 2023 and Wednesday 29 Nov 2023 to request to terminate. They refused. Now, my son is so stressed and blames himself for signing up a gym membership. It is shocking that students are being targeted in this manner.
