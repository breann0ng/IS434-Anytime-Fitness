Anytime Fitness Changi,Justin Hoyo,3,"Not my resident gym, but decided to give it a try! The equipment here are well-maintained. Power racks are sufficient with competition-standard barbells. However the free-weights area needs some improvements. Benches and dumbbells are not maintained properly.

I would say this is more of a powerlifting gym (discouraged for regular gym-goers). The lifters here often “hog” the racks, come in big groups, and take LONG rest times. Properly wouldn’t visit this gym again.

Staff here are friendly though! :)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRd283TFpREAE
Anytime Fitness Changi,Syahiran,5,"Very well-organised gym with a clean and welcoming environment. The staff, particularly Ana, went above and beyond to help me with my needs and queries. She is really friendly and euphoric throughout our interaction.

This isn’t my home club but would gladly recommend to anyone who is a member or who is looking to sign up. 10/10.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25OMlZrVXdNRGs1UW5kYU5FeE5WMXBmTUVRMFduYxAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,Jack,4,"This is not my home club as it's not near where I stay or work, but having visited it for the first time last week I wished this was my home gym!
The layout is great, so many different machines that I do not see in other AF, especially back machines. There's a nice view from the 2nd floor. And best part is, lots of sports outlet stores here to get your latest workout gear!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3NWVMQmVBEAE
Anytime Fitness Changi,Will,5,"The staff at the counter is friendly and the place is so well laid out and personalised. The ladies has many items for sharing.

But there is only 1 toilet. Makes waiting for it difficult.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRMmZybV9RRRAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,E Lee,5,"Best AF so far IN THE EAST! except the choice of music during midnight.. the hardstyle music has to go!!
Nice new equipments, tons of it, a good range, gym is clean and well maintained. Lots of foam rollers, very thoughtful. Gym has good ventilation, lots of fans and the aircon is good! Personally love the toilets as it’s separated between male and female.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKcUs2NHhRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,Judy Tan,5,"My home gym. I’d go around to try out the other AF gyms with high ratings since I signed up end of last year. Feels like the ratings of some of them are solicited but oh well.

This one is deserving though. Everyone in there are like friends and really welcoming. I bumped into Amirah near my home couple of weeks after I signed up and she called out to me by name. Like how did she even remember my name even if she remembered my face after such a short period of time?

The gym is clean, users are mostly friendly and willing to rotate/share equipments. Love that the gym equipments are well maintained.

Male and female bathrooms are separated (rare for Anytime Fitness gyms).

I’m so relieved this is my home gym. Phew.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZc3JtSGVREAE

Anytime Fitness Changi,Muhammad Yusri Ng Yang Yun,5,"Great gym overall! The equipment is top-notch, and the vibes/ambiance are really nice. The staff is super friendly, and the service is a solid 10/10. I also appreciated that when I wanted to cancel, they didn’t pressure me to stay, which says a lot about their professionalism. The changing rooms are always tidy and clean. The only minor downside is that they sometimes reply late, but everything else is great.  😊",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRcmUtRGJnEAE

Anytime Fitness Changi,Isnarti Noordin,5,"Love the ambience at this gym. It’s a safe space and welcoming place  for gym goers , with top notch equipment and wonderful staff.

It’s a pretty spacious gym with quite a big variety of machines that you don’t usually find in other AF gyms.   Place is generally neat and equipment are well maintained. Nice to see that they provide each equipment with sanitizer spray and wipe down towel.

The higher ceiling and natural light from the many surrounding windows add on to the feeling of spaciousness and good energy at this gym.

Very friendly and welcoming staff at the gym too!

The only unfortunate recent development happening ,  the mall is under renovation and reconfiguration, leading to a relocation of nearest escalator further away as well as shrinkage of free space / stretching area.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUN3dVBIYTBRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,Muzammil Peer,5,"I've been a member of Anytime Fitness CCP for a while now, and it has truly been a fantastic experience. The gym boasts a vast space with well-thought-out equipment placement, ensuring plenty of room to work out comfortably. The ambience is great, making it a conducive environment for all gym-goers.

The amenities are top-notch, and the toilets are always fully stocked. However, it would be even better if there were at least one more toilet facility in the gents. 🤣

I must highlight the exceptional service provided by Shah, the most brilliant staff member at Anytime Fitness CCP. Shah is incredibly helpful and makes everyone feel right at home. He takes immense pride in his work, ensuring that no issue goes unnoticed. His dedication to providing the best experience for gym-goers is truly commendable. Shah's attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond make him a standout asset to the gym.

Bumi brings an unparalleled level of energy and positivity that motivates both staff and members. Shah's commitment to ensuring a smooth operation is evident in his reliability and attention to detail. Ari's knowledge and willingness to go above and beyond have been key to our success.

Anytime Fitness Changi,Spartan Dan,5,"First time coming here since I knew last time this place was gonna open up.

When I enter the gym and I saw 4 power racks, I know this gym is gonna be good.

Toilets were clean. And toiletries provided was useful. Appreciate it. Donwside is that only have one toilet so there is once, I need to go use and someone was using so I had to hold my pee in for a bit 😂

Other than that, can see people were nice too. Environment is fresh and clean. Spacious. Maybe cause I went in a non peak hrs. But can imagine if it's crowded. But with such huge space, I think can accommodate la.

Equipment were in good condition. Barbells, power racks, deadlift platforms. Dumbbells, barbells and ez curl bars. Not forgetting the machines. All is good. Thanks!! Would definitely visit here again.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxc0lIYnVBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,amdeefitness,5,"This is our home base gym. Convenient, clean, and the manager Shah is always upbeat, friendly, and watches out for his clients/gym users. As much as we love the accessibility of the gym and the friendliness of the gym goers there, we would love it if there was a better system for putting back the weights and for sorting them according to weight (difficult I know but we can hope)!!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzcjViVDV3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,Farah Irfahyanna,5,"I’ve been a member of AF CCP for quite sometime now and I just wanted to leave a review. As I was looking through other gyms’ reviews (because I’d like to see which is more convenient to my next stop for work) and all I see is bad reviews of the gyms such as low maintenance, bad hygiene, etc.

The gym here is amazing. Great use of space. A lot of machines. Not to mention there’s separate toilets for males and females (this is really awesome for a hijabi like me!) Staff are friendly and consistent. I’m not familiar with their names but I can recognise their faces 😙

Location is good with a view too. A lot of outlet stores. Food varieties as well. Highly recommend to come and visit the gym!

Cleanliness: 8.5/10
Machines: 9/10
Staff: 9/10",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNueDRpcU1REAE
Anytime Fitness Changi,Ian Tan Wee,5,"This review is especially dedicated to one of the staff at Changi City Point AF, Jun Long. Respectable and Professional young individual, from being able to welcome members of this wonderful gym or more so I should say a family. One being such that he is able to make me feel like home in this gym. Another special quality of him, would be being able to guide me through a workout. Able to demonstrate certain movements in various exercises with precision, checking my form and range of motion for me to execute the movement correctly. With such quality of teaching, I am able to stray away from any sort of unnecessary injuries due to bad form.

Thank you Tan Jun Long, you have really make a deep impact on my life. I would highly recommend him to anybody in the gym, who needs a trainer !",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMdk1HTTBRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Changi,Nobu,3,"Gym floor is clean and spacious.
Toilet is always kept clean too.
Love the variety of equipments available in the gym! Nowadays, not many gym have the space and equipment to cover most exercises.

What I don’t appreciate.
It’s when specific group of members who have no respect for the gym:
- Wear slippers or crocs while training.
- Tripods everywhere. Sometimes is strange locations. (Tripping hazard)
- Bags on the floor, not at the pigeon holes. (Tripping hazard)
- Liquid/powder chalk bottles on the floor (Again tripping hazards)
- Unnecessary slamming on the platform with no effort to control. I came across many powerlifters and this one of the worst (not even advance level).

If members can’t respect the gym, it shows how much they respect the gym management.
Perhaps you may wish to look into the standards.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUeTVUMTlRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Changi,Gab “gift_of_the_gab”,3,"I’ve been a regular at CCP AF and one thing that I really appreciate at the gym is the very welcoming staff, specifically Jay. Jay was very welcoming whenever I was in the gym. As I was usually in the gym by myself, he would often come up to talk to me which made me feel a lot more comfortable and even encouraged me to push myself further in my workouts (I even set a few PRs because of his encouragement). He is always willing to help my friends and I with exercises that he had learnt and also shows concern when we haven’t been to the gym in a while. This is one of the reasons I choose to stick with this AF even though it isn’t the closest outlet to where I live.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMbk55d09nEAE

In the gym, J's enthusiasm and energy are contagious. In addition to making the gym feel so friendly, J can also be a great motivator at times. Kenneth and Shawn are the other staff members. Their shared commitment to assisting clients in reaching their fitness objectives as personal trainers are admirable. Additionally, they have a remarkable capacity to challenge clients while keeping them safe. Their dedication to help others in changing their bodies and lives are truly commendable.

Lastly, part of why this gym runs efficiently is thanks to Lucas's great leadership and management abilities, which also foster a positive work atmosphere for both employees and customers. Lucas is a true asset to this fitness community.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURacDRqUU5REAE
