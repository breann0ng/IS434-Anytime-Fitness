Anytime Fitness Rochester,A H,1,"I used to frequent this gym because it’s new and conveniently located, but over time the experience has gone downhill. The only staff members who consistently greet and make members feel welcome are the PT (gentleman) and the Malay Club Associate (gentleman)— both always professional and friendly. Unfortunately, the rest of the team, especially the boy with glasses and some of the female staff, show little to no warmth or acknowledgement. They sashay around as though they own the gym, instead of working for the gym they are in. It really sets a poor impression of the outlet’s culture compared to other branches.

For a new gym, the maintenance is also disappointing. The air-conditioning leaks at random spots (especially on the second level near the benches on the right), and the ceiling fans seem to turn on and off without reason — not to mention the loud noises they make.

The team here could definitely learn a thing or two about customer service and basic body language from the two staff mentioned earlier. I used to come here out of convenience, but I’ll be switching to other outlets like BV or HV, which offer a much better overall experience nor staffs monkey around in the presence of members.

Kudos again to the PT and the Malay Club Associate for their friendliness — they’re the only reason this gym still has any redeeming qualities (unhealthy sweet and snacks on the table, leaky wet tissues ain't doing it). Hopefully, higher management reviews both the service culture and maintenance issues soon.
