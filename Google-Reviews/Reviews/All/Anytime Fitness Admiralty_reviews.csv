Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Toyohiro,5,"Clean and cosy gym with a great vibe. One of the best parts about this gym is Axel — he’s not just a staff member, but also a great gym buddy! He’s super friendly, always willing to guide and help, and makes working out feel less intimidating. Joey is also very nice and approachable. The space is clean, well-equipped, and never too packed. Perfect for anyone who prefers a more personal and comfortable gym environment!",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Mr Nice,3,"The gym is clean. Yup. Equipments are limited yet sufficient. I have to give 3 stars. No toilets, only 1 water cooler, and the gym is pretty small.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Roshan Ro,2,"Although the gym looks nice, it is incredibly small compared to other outlets which can be very much improved on as 15 people inside the gym can already cause it to look overcrowded and time wasted waiting for the machines can rather be spent travelling to other outlets instead. However, if they do expand I will change my rating due to the proximity of this place.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Admiralty,khrhms,3,"Average AF outlet as compared to others. Quite small and cramped with limited machines available. However, I guess it’s a good spot for a quick cardio workout on weekdays because the crowd here is much lesser than the bigger outlets. Not much space for free weights/body weight workouts too. No vending machine available, only a water cooler. Ok gym overall, might need a makeover and for $100 wouldn’t recommend this as a home gym.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Emerick Mitchell Donovan,1,"STAY AWAY! For your own good.
This has been, hands down, the worst customer service experience I’ve ever encountered. I’m writing this so others can make an informed decision before signing up.

I’ve been a loyal member of Anytime Fitness since 2018. On 7 April 2025, I underwent an emergency stomach operation. I was placed on Hospitalisation Leave until 2 May, and subsequently given light duty until 29 May—meaning no strenuous activity or exercise was allowed during this recovery period, as per medical advice.

On 11 April, I reached out to the Admiralty Anytime Fitness outlet via text with the medical memo, requesting a freeze on my account until 29 May. I also asked for the April payment (which I had already made but couldn’t use) to be offset in my June bill. A simple, reasonable request—one that other gyms I’m a member of had no issue accommodating with empathy and zero hassle.

What followed was a mess. They got back to me days later saying they'd waive 24 days of April and charge me $11.53 instead of $85 for May. The math didn’t add up, so I broke it down for them clearly (screenshots available). That’s when the excuses started. Suddenly, I was told a 30-day advance notice was required to freeze memberships. How exactly does one give 30 days' notice for an emergency surgery?

It got worse. I was then told that “light duty” meant I could do “light workouts.” Let that sink in; a fitness outlet trying to interpret a medical memo in their favor. I explained it simply meant I could return to office to do desk work.

After further follow-up, they came back and said they’d now only waive the month of May.
I asked—again—if they could simply offset April’s payment in my June bill, as I couldn't use the gym while recovering from surgery. I wasn’t asking for a refund. Just a deferment/offset. They refused.

They began asking if this injury/operation was caused by the gym. How in the WORLD is that relevant?

They also refused to let me speak to management or send me the contract terms when I requested them—twice. Instead, I was told:
“Under contract T&Cs, members have to pay regardless of whether they come or not.”

As if that wasn’t dismissive enough, they said “
If today you lost your phone and you can't use your telco services anymore for 2 weeks, you do not go to your telco and tell them to refund you the $ since u do not have your phone to use their services right..”

Yes, that was the example and comparison given.

Frankly, I’m shocked. After seven years of loyalty, this is the level of treatment towards a paying customer. The experience has been nothing short of appalling, and I would urge anyone considering a membership at this outlet to think twice.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Zhengting,3,Okay sized gym. Equipment's new and good. But overall rlly hot and smelly which ruins the experience. Hope the owners can turn up the ac and perhaps investigate the cause of the smell (usually at the corners of the gym),Date not found
Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Yufan Zou,1,"It’s a scam, especially the owner Axel, when I was about to terminate the account in March 2025, he suggested that he can help to pause the account first for as long as I want, WITHOUT informing me the policy for pause account is 3 months only.

I was auto charged for July 2025 and when I reach out to anytime fitness to terminate my account, they say need to serve 30 days notice, which means I’m charged for extra 2 months out of my agreement. Also, for the notice month, I need to paynow them separately, not deducting from Giro, it’s very sus.

It’s a scam, they just trying to charge you as much as they can and squeeze all the benefit from you out of their “policies” without giving you the full information.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Admiralty,N. Laughpuff,1,"Do not recommend. You are paying twice as much to wait twice as long. Its packed majority of the time and there's only 1 machine per excercise, 1 rank 1 smith. Unless the location is the only thing u care about otherwise, its really not worth the money and your time.

Edit: Also, why is half the gym dedicated to treadmills and bicycles? The gym is small enough, if people are going there to jog... Just jog around the neighbourhood lol. Are people really paying $100 a month to jog in the gym?",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Sankar Kris,1,"There is a trap. Before sign MEMBERSHIP,  please make sure that you are on contract or non contract? My case, what I understand during enrolling that one month notice for cancelation is enough but after few months use of the gym (rarely use) wants to terminate due to personal issues and contacted the admin of anytime fitness then they brings up all the points  that I could not cancel and my contract locked for one year.  Whether I am using the gym or not, I have to pay. I asked any chance to cancel they said that there is a way to terminate the contract that ""THE PERSON MUST BE NO MORE"" OR ""DOCTOR CERITIFIED THAT THE PERSON NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE GYM PERMANENTLY""  My kind advise to new users,
PLEASE MAKE SURE UNDERSTAND YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS BEFORE USE.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Toshies,4,"Pros :
Very friendly staff. Well equipped gym. Tidy and clean. Convenient and accessible location. They used to play gym music openly thru a speaker which sometimes some gym users might abuse it by blasting their music out loud esp during wee hrs when there's no staff around. Now, they play it thru a TV instead and at a much lower volume so i think thats a very good move because these days gym-goers mostly have their own music that they listen to with their own earbuds ect.

Cons :
Not too sure about other franchise but i think this place might be a little bit too pricey for its membership. Why i felt so is because this place has no built-in toilet nor shower place and if compared to other outlets that has all those facilities, the price is more or less the same hence making this outlet seem pricier. Also this place is much smaller compared to its neighbouring outlet. But this is just my honest thoughts and only grouse i have is the pricing. Thats all. Apart from that, this gym along with its staff and management has been awesome!",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Grace Lim,1,"I'm trying to survey prices and packages for gyms in the area. Got contacted by the gym and they have been very shady about their prices. Will not reveal to me the exact price and packages either (only mentioned range $90-150) and kept pushing me to drop by to find out the prices. The worst kind of sales tactic. Especially during the pandemic point, they don't allow trials which is fair enough. Then what's the point you're increasing number of people in the gym by asking people to drop by? Don't allow gyms to do this to customers. Businesses should be transparent. Stop using MLM tactics.

Edit: Pricing policy is also not disclosed to me since you've brought it up. I don't have any interest in supporting shady tactics in business practices. My review is a warning to other potential people like me just trying to make good concious consumer decisions. Declining the invite to tour the gym as it's time-wasting if your prices itself are not favorable. Also read that there are no lockers or showers so I can't understand the crazy high price either.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Admiralty,Jim Ng,2,"Not a fan of the lack of maintenance of equipment, alongside the fact that if you'd like to refer a friend in you'd have to constantly arrange an appointment during office hours.

In theory, office workers only have time to work out before and after office hours so the theory is kinda flawed.

Additionally, the gym has a strict policy of not allowing you to play music with their speakers.

The gym recently installed new prism+ TVs that plays music that intermittently cuts off, which is a huge disturbance and pain in the @** if you ask me.

Driving to other gyms in the future like Woods Square's anytime fitness instead.
