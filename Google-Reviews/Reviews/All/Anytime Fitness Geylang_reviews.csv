Anytime Fitness Geylang,Alexander Aaltonen,5,"Love this AF outlet! Well-planned and efficient layout considering its small size. The staff is super friendly and always greet you with a smile. Occasionally free treats are also offered to members!

The gym itself includes all the essential machines and equipment. The facilities are also well maintained -- always feels neat and clean here!

As the gym is quite small, it might get quite crowded, but usually I go very late when there's less people, so not a problem at all for me 🙌",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1Z2RUbnFRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Geylang,Lucien Lim,5,"A well-equipped 24h gym that is clean and well maintained. The equipment look new and function well. The only issue I see here is the lack of wheelchair access (no lift available), as the gym is divided into 3 floors accessible by staircase.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtdWJEdmxBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Geylang,Gary Ang,5,"This is a relatively small gym, it has a different feel of the gym compared to other AF. I actually like the lay out of the gym, it seems a little bit cramped but the usage of the space is excellent! Lighting was good at level 2 and 3. Love it when a gym has diverging lats pull down. Was greeted warmly by the staff when I entered. Parking can be tricky around geylang and MRT is around 10-15min walk away.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1dElIcEp3EAE
Anytime Fitness Geylang,Thomas Lee,4,"Great gym. Small(but all you need available), equipment packed efficiently and friendly staff.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2twelRXaHdPRkF3Ukd0RVNHUTNXVVpyVFVGWGNVRRAB
Anytime Fitness Geylang,Moriba Konate,3,"Pros: gym is well equipped with all sorts of machines (if that’s your thing) and the people are super nice

Cons: space is quite tight with everything on top of each other. Only 2 squats racks which are in front of each other and quite close to the ceiling. The bar was touching the top beam as I was shoulder pressing.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYM2FxNmRREAE
Anytime Fitness Geylang,Alex Neville,5,Great small gym. Made excellent use of the space. Staff are generally lovely and the equipment is in good condition.

Anytime Fitness Geylang,WS Yong,5,"This AF has probably the friendliest staff I've encountered so far in SG, owner is friendly too; even though it's not the one I signed up under, and also group classes. Not that crowded either.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRbmM3VHlBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Geylang,Lyn Sarah MY,5,"Great service by Elyana and Alif, welcoming and friendly.

1st time in the gym.  Even though it is a bit narrow but makes up for the 3 floors, clean and nice scent.  Equipment spaced out nicely.

Went for the Bodypump class by Instructor Mon on Thursday evening.  Informative and jovial.  A lot of strength and stamina considering he taught 2 classes back to back.  😅

Will come back.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIck5lbWx3RRAB
