Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Saint Ghost,5,"Been to this gym for quite some time now actually. Solid place + good music, cant complain. Indeed very convenient! All the staffs there were pretty friendly and helpful with my questions regarding about fitness. Anyway, many thank you staff Shahrezan for your hard work in helping me figuring out which equipment to use for certain workout. No issues with cleanliness, should come by! ❤️",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcXQtNXhRRRAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Rat Chef,2,"I've been a member of Anytime Fitness for a while now, and there is an increasing amount of people wearing completely inappropriate footwear. I've seen multiple members working out in sandals, slides, and slip-ons, which is not only unsafe but also against basic gym etiquette.

Proper footwear is essential for safety and support, yet it seems like no one is enforcing this rule. It would be great if the staff could step up and ensure that everyone follows basic gym dress codes.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3dktuZUlREAE
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Wong Peiliang (Guy Wong),1,"I went to this gym thrice over 3 weeks. This is my honest review after the 3 experiences & not 1 off. I really like to love this gym as it is closest to me, but it seriously needs a refresh and surgery! This is the 2nd oldest AF gym in SG, but they really didn't maintain it! Worst of all the AF gyms I have been to in SG so far.

Gym is really old and dirty. I honestly do not think that cleaning was done over these 3 weeks. My nose itches
when I am at dumbbell rack for extended period. Dirt and dust have gathered at corners of machines (photo of dust at Pec machine), thick layer of dust from aircon, dirt from dumbbell racks have not been cleaned since my 1st visit 3 weeks ago. Equipment has rusted or have seriously been used beyond point of replacement (see 9kg dumbbell, exposed plates and attachments). The weights barbell of the short barbells used for curls are also not labelled. Each barbell's weight was off and I had to measure via the weighing machine to conclude that 3 barbells weighed 6.4kg, 8kg and 12.8kg. another one rusted at side which I didn't bother.

Also have entitled old member (Saw him on 2 of the 3 times I went) that I saw bring up his personal bike to park inside the gym and once letting the community stray cat in, which terrified a female user and also caused stress for other users as we were worried of hurting it by accident.

Please give a thumbs up if you have a bad experience at this gym too so that the algorithm can push this review out more and help other people.

Thanks.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQxOGJ1LTVnRRAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Lucien Lim,4,"A well equipped branch of AF strategically located at MacPherson Community Club (3rd Floor). Some of the equipment is old/broken, but the gym is otherwise well-maintained and clean.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcDU3dUVnEAE
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,R J,1,"Saw a bicycle parked inside the gym and everyone is either working out in slides, slippers or crocs. Given it’s late at night but there’s CCTV all around so maybe it’s just bad control from the management? Avoid at all cost !",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURudC1teDhRRRAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,孔香味,5,The smallest one I’ve ever been while there aren’t too many people. So it is ok lah,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT210UmVGUlFaVTEzZFRsa2JHSjVVamxMYWtOWFRHYxAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Gary Ang,4,"Definitely one of the smallest AF out there, but that's the model of AF. This gym has been around for almost 10 years, it belongs to the pioneer of AF in Singapore. Equipment are well maintain, it has almost everything you need, and for such a small gym, I think it's really a good gym for the neighborhood.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKeS1iczZRRRAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,MuhdNur Haziq,5,Shah is helpful and considerate. An asset to the company. Highly recommended.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21RelUxbFJNRU5YYVVwemQzVmliMTlyTTNORFRFRRAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Xyriz,2,"Not a great experience with my trial session. Olympic bars are so old that the treads are smoothened out and rusting, olympic bars isn’t even that expensive to replace? Most foam and rubber grips on their machines have given up. Disappointed at the staff, they just went to their lair after I arrived and I only asked after more than 5 minutes of standing if I am waiting for something, apparently didn’t even think about showing me around and explaining the pricing, I had to tell them how to do their supposed job. Not sure maybe he is the owner and already swimming in money and don’t need my business. 🤣 I won’t workout here even if you pay me, sorry just relaying my experience!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRX0xyQ09BEAE

Anytime Fitness MacPherson,sy,2,"The gym lacks a female-friendly environment due to the absence of light-weight dumbbells and the poor condition of the available ones, some with torn rubber. Improvement in the dumbbell selection is crucial for safety and inclusivity, making the gym a more welcoming space for all members.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROZzl2WFNnEAE
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Aaron Thor,3,"I was a member here for years but shifted away, 2-3 years later I decided to visit old gym buddies and look at the “renovation”. Equipments are still usable even after years tho I wish the barbell could be new ones as the rust built up so much.
Dumbbells, machine equipments, plates are still good tho it’s super dusty which is a health and safety concern. Good old friends are still there which makes this place awesome as it was.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwdXJMTFVnEAE
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Mr Wang Wang,1,"Decent, expensive gym, no gym instructor or personnel to take charge of the gym most of the time. The gym users are so terrible, Usually on weekends those users keep dropping the weight on the floor after using.... Damaging the gym equipment and causing loud noise.

Edit: the Gym user keeps dropping the weight. Less than a star worth!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Z2ZXek1REAE
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Suriyaprasad Vijayakumar,2,"Avergae gym with couple of rare equipments for legs  but sadly the toilet stinks very bad could smell the drainage through out the toilet.

Ps : Trainers could be friendly and welcoming to people visiting the gym. I visited today from 2pm till 5pm",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0eDR5azR3RRAB
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Alex Sim,5,"Best AF outlet in the neighborhood because of the 3 extremely awesome hidden gems in the team, Shah, Lawrence and Kovin who make me look forward to walking through the door like your home, and always feel satisfaction when you leave.

Can't compare to other bigger outlet in the malls, but sufficient enough that feels more personal even during certain peak hours.
Incomparable to those commerical gym equipments but with innovative, never an issue for sure.
Staffs are extremely approachable.
Highly recommended!!!👍👍

Only down side to be avoid from personal experience, stench of body odors from certain members occasion walking pass, discomfort your training while the load is still on you!!!
We frequent this gym know when to avoid, not like some other outlets which so hard to predict such disastrous situation.🤭",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdWVMR1ZREAE
Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Max Lim,1,"it has a very nice scent of body odor upon stepping into the gym you could feel the aroma scented towards you motivating you to work as quickly as possible.

The free weights are so well equipped some are not ragged and there is absolutely no dirt stain and cracks. The equipment's are all very well placed in an orderly manner such that no one will fall when walking.

The music motivates you to work slowly and steadily, last but not least they possible won the world best gym body odour in Singapore.

This sarcasm was written in a nice way as I sincerely hope the gym personnel will improve on the gym condition.

Regards,
Max",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzcVBXUDdRRRAB

Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Clement Teh,4,"This is the usual styling of most Anytime Fitness Gym. It is housed in a community club in Macpherson cc. The gym is small but is well equipped.

Anytime Fitness MacPherson,Tim Habelito,3,"Quite difficult to find as the only sign on the gym is dim and hard to see from the street, also there are no street signs giving directions to the gym which is on the upper flr of the Community club. Gym is one of the smaller AF around with limited machines compared to other branches. No specific area/room for circuit training and stretching. wifi is not available to the public like most AF, only for staff. Able to get a decent workout though as all the standard equipment is there.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnalBTYWFnEAE
