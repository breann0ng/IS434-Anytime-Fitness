Anytime Fitness Chong Pang,Syakir Bahreen,5,"My honest review, i rank AF Chong Pang #1 in Yishun . Overall gym is well equipped, clean and cosy place to workout. Not as crowded as gym located in malls. Location is also near eateries that are open till quite late. Staff are kind and approachable! Great environment 5/5 ❤️",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25aak5sVTNkakE1UzJKS2JVMDJPREJUU1RWSE1WRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chong Pang,Irwan Kusuma,5,"If you're looking for a gem of a gym that balances convenience with quality, this place is worth checking out. Although it's compact, it packs all the essential equipment needed for a full-body workout.

One of the biggest perks for me is its proximity—it's just a quick 5-minute walk from my house. This makes it incredibly easy to fit in a workout at any time that suits me, including the early hours of the morning. I love hitting the gym at 5 a.m., when it's blissfully quiet and I can experiment with different workout techniques without any pressure. There’s no need to worry about taking too long or inconveniencing other gym-goers.

Another great feature is the free drinks and fruits available every Friday. It’s a fantastic way to stay refreshed and energized after a workout, plus it’s a nice touch that shows they care about their members' overall well-being.

In summary, this gym may be small, but it’s perfectly equipped, conveniently located, and offers a great atmosphere for those early or off-peak hours. The added bonus of free drinks and fruit on Fridays is just the cherry on top. Highly recommend for anyone seeking a local, hassle-free workout experience!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURibVo2clRREAE
Anytime Fitness Chong Pang,Ming Liang,5,"This AF stands out as one of the finest gym facilities in Singapore, if not the best. The gym premises and equipment are consistently maintained to high standards, and what sets them apart is the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff.

Despite being newly opened, they have shown remarkable patience and professionalism in meeting my personal needs. I have never encountered such hospitality at any other gym before, which is why I felt compelled to write this review praising their excellence.

This is definitely a gym worth supporting and working out in!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiOHUycWhnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chong Pang,Alex K,5,"If you're looking for a gym that delivers top-notch equipment, a welcoming atmosphere, and a true sense of community, look no further than [AF CHONG PANG]! While it may not be the biggest gym around, it more than makes up for it with the best machines, free weights, and functional training gear you could ask for. Every piece of equipment is well-maintained and high-quality, making every workout smooth and effective.

Beyond the equipment, what really makes this gym special is the people. The staff are incredibly friendly, always ready to help, and genuinely invested in your fitness journey. And to top it all off, the owner is one of the nicest and most approachable people you’ll meet. You can tell they truly care about their members, constantly ensuring everyone feels comfortable, motivated, and supported.

The gym is always clean, never overcrowded, and has an inviting atmosphere that keeps you coming back. If you want a gym that offers the best equipment, the friendliest staff, and an owner who treats you like family, [AF CHONG PANG] is the place to be. Highly recommend!

Ps they have the best abs machine I’ve ever seen in SG!!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNnX09qUTdBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chong Pang,Siti Zahirah,5,"Cozy homely gym despite being smaller than other AF gyms out there. 5 min walk from my place which is a big perk. Despite its limited compact size (single unit), it has enough/balanced equipments like free weights, benches and machines if you are looking for strength training. Not much cardio machines but no biggie. The gym is well maintained and the staff are friendly, especially YH and Matin. Max capacity is 10-12 pax before it gets abit cramped/crowded. Overall am satisfied with the gym. I will give a 4.5 out of 5. ( a -0.5 point for the toilet which will be great if can revamp)",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBLW96WG9nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chong Pang,Joyce Lee,5,"Super glad that this branch opened up because it's really close to my place and now I have no excuse not to exercise! Staff members are always super friendly,  even the boss will greet the regulars by name.
Granted, the place is small but very well maintained and in my own humble opinion, has a decent variety of machines to work out on. There are also days when I come in and there's a box of complimentary drinks and fruits that you can help yourself to!
Do be warned, this outlet is sandwiched between many nearby restaurants (including McDonald's) so be prepared to fight the junk calories temptation post-workout, hahaha",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMMG95VVB3EAE
