Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,4,"Decent variety of equipments but there's no hip thrust machine. Other than that, gym has adequate machines and squat racks to get a decent workout in. Some of the weight plates are old. Take note you have to use a different entrance in-between 9pm and 9am.

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Alexander Aaltonen,1,"Sad to say that this is the worst AF gym I've visited. Been to several ones in SG as well as Malaysia, Australia, The Philippines, Taiwan and Hong Kong... this branch falls well below the usual AF standards 🫠

I came here for the first time back in 2021 when it was still decent, not great but good enough. Now after revisiting a couple years later, it seems like nothing has been renewed and the facilities and equipment are poorly maintained. The worst part is... the place seems to be hit by a nasty cockroach infestation 🪳

Seems like a revamp + pest control is long overdue -- you got to do better! This is just sad.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyOGJpLUR3EAE

Part time staff named Iman, friendly and informative! Thank you for answering some queries which i had! Keep being helpful and amazing :)
(As most of the time i gym after office hours or midnight hence don't really see full-timers staff.)

• Not a big gym
• Very Convenient to those stay near the area and wants to exercise at any timing.

• Not received the Anytime Fitness T-Shirt from New Member sign-up package until after about 1 year, DIDN'T notify me when stock arrived despite Promised, i had to keep checking with them every few months😞

Except the above mentioned, all seems fine imho.

√ It will be perfect if the Management actually deliver what they promised. Thank you for being at this mall :)

It will be excellent if have a more solid punching bag and better placement with more space, the current and placement isn't satisfying with how it is, but yeah you get what you pay.

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,kiriny ʕ·ᴥ· ʔ,1,"signed in 2021 but the gym has went down in terms of quality and maintenance since then.
equipment maintenance:
- most of the steel plates are in shambles, rusty and coating chipped off (see pic)
- deadlift platform broken for some time (see pic), every time need to kick it back into position
- leg extension machine broke down a few times and took some time to be fixed only for it to be broken again
- machines rusty/ worn (see pic), attachments broken (see pic)

environment/ cleanliness
- locker area always smelling like sweat, very musty. can't stand there for long and my friends and i have to hold our breath there. personally i’ve gagged a few times.
- washroom smells funky sometimes, found a dead roach as well.
- aircon is weak, dusty fans not helping (see pic), overall ventilation is poor
- not sure what’s going on with the walls (water stain, dust bunnies)

although cleanliness doesn’t affect your workout, it does bring down the overall ambience. it’s really a downer to work out in a gym where you can tell there isn’t much effort put into maintaining an okay environment for you. even if replacing worn equipment isn’t possible, the least that can be done is to maintain a clean environment for people who are paying ~$100 monthly.  other AFs have much better equipment maintenance, cleanliness, and general ambience yet charge the same price.

only coming here for convenience as it’s the nearest gym to me and to clock in my hours else my membership will be transferred to other AFs.

1 point cos i met a bunch of new friends here. community is not bad, lots of regular lifters and familiar faces.

hopefully management takes some form of action.

update Feb'24:
removed toilet paper from all cubicles to restrict usage, leaving only one roll outside for us to ""take what we need"". friends have mentioned they started locking up the toilets to restrict use as well.

notice all the 5 star reviews and how the accounts leaving them have 1-2 other reviews only? 🤔 believe management gets them to leave good reviews when they sign up for some signup goodie bag

if there is a 0 star, i will give. i want to give -20 star but i cannot so 1 star.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKdmRqQ0N3EAE

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Ezxm,1,"Plan to sign up again but with the environmental review from others active gym members. To be honest its mind blowing. Use to enjoy the facility back then in term of equipment and hygiene but upon read the recent review its seems that the gym didn’t do proper hygiene cleaning. Disgusting pictures had been put up but non action to be taken from the vendor. Faulty equipment shouldn’t lift it there, you guys should put it away. This heavy equipment is very dangerous the impact can cause death. As a franchise you need to be honoured on what you doing. Restructure the facility first then i can consider continue. Yucks! Disgusting gym! Should report to the authorities.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiaXBxZkNREAE
Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Alessander Fong,2,"have been a member at this place since they opened but decided  a few months ago to moved my homegym membership to another AF that deserves my monthly payment. Even though they 'refreshed' their place some months ago, it's just cosmetic wise looking better. equipment are still rusty and broken, nothing new at all. hygiene wise is one of the worst even seen in my life,

1)they don't even enforce people bringing their own towel. i have seen someone whose sweat stained singlet used the bench and just move to another workout with wiping.  told the staff on duty and they can only say they can't do anything.

2)they provide general towel and alcohol spray but the towel is one of the most disgusting one, towel is always damp and i have not seen them changing it to a new one at all for the longest time.

3)the final straw they broke was when they removed all the toilet papers and told the members to use bidet. hiding behind the name of 'environment friendly'(more like profit saving).paired this with the non enforcement of using towel. i have seen people leaving lump of stain on the bench after they left. no prize for guesting that this is likely to be after using the bidet and their private area are still wet, without any TP to dry then they used the bench for workout. i can't believe i was in Singapore. still come here due to the bigger space so give it 2*

you also should be seeing all the current 5* reviews with a few sentences? well they are giving some incentives for these reviews to jack up the rating. With all the new sign up, they have more than enough profit to do something to the gym but management just decided not to. if you are new please ask and plan to sign up with them, please ask them what are their hygiene policy and what equirement have they changed since their renovation.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBMjRPWnBRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Sarah Santhiya,5,"As a first-time gym-goer, I was inspired by my friends’ positive experiences and decided to join Anytime Fitness (AF) Wisteria Mall. The newly renovated space is well-lit, perfectly air-conditioned, and very welcoming.

The staff, including Sagai Mary, Gillian, Trampoline class instructor Noor, and PT instructor Ben, made me feel right at home from the start.

A special shoutout to Sagai Mary! As the assistant manager, she was incredibly detailed and meticulous during my sign-up process. She wasn’t just professional but also warm and approachable, never pushing me into decisions. Her friendliness and genuine smile truly reflect the positive vibes at AF. Mary also went the extra mile to educate me on how to use the equipment, which boosted my confidence as a newbie.

Overall, it’s a 100/100 for AF Wisteria Mall from me! I highly recommend it to anyone :)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfMG9XS0ZnEAE

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Kayla Tan,1,"just signed up not long ago , probs 1 month ago. i would just like to mention a few things. although this gym has 4 stars due to the reviews being placed when it was newly opened , the quality has dropped drastically. firstly , this af has one of the worst amenities i have seen in a gym. it is small , claustrophobic and has limited equipment , moreover , most of the equipment are either rusty or run-down and some of them are even out of order , making my experience very unpleasant. secondly , the staff here are terrible. on my first day at this af , i requested for a tour and a quick run down on how to use the machines. there was a malay male staff only which seemed extremely reluctant to do so , and when asked how to use the machines , he seemed condescending and was not patient even though i was obviously a beginner and wanted to genuinely learn. he left a terrible impression right away. thirdly , for a monthly payment of $95 , this is absolutely a huge scam , lack of machines and equipment , terrible staff members , musty smell at the bag area , it seemed to me like the staff couldnt give a care in the world at all. fourthly , i signed the contract with my full name written correctly and the agreement sent to me had my name mispelled , wrote an email to them asking them to change it. until now , there has been no amendments made. this is shocking as on my first few days at the gym , i frequently see that malay male staff sitting and looking at his monitor , so it makes no absolute sense why he couldnt reply to my email. i found this behaviour absolutely appalling. lastly , as a neighbourhood gym that is accessible for 24 hours and requires a monthly payment of $95 , this is atrocious considering the poor maintenance of the facility and the ignorant staff members. moreover , no cancellation within the period of signing up unless there is medical or relocation proof. this i felt was ridiculous. some people would obviously like to cancel the membership due to other reasons , perhaps they are busy with work and have no time to go the gym , and obviously they wouldnt want to pay $95 a month and waste it. as a consumer myself , the amenities in this gym are appalling considering the extremely high price point. the gym needs a major revamp in order to prove its worth. seriously , this is a scam. i would highly suggest anyone that is considering to sign up for af to think properly about it first before making rash decisions , staff members love to pursue you into signing up for memberships that cant be cancelled unless for some ridiculous reasons.
overall , this af is extremely not worth its monthly price and the amenities are absolute garbage.
plus , staff members really need to watch their attitude , especially that one malay male staff. gave me the impression that he didnt feel like working anymore , which i feel would be for the better , since his attitude and body language was revolting.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxODR5bG1BRRAB

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,Mat Leo,1,"Ok gym but pathetic management.

Useless personal Trainers that only wants your
Money and make you do useless and stupid exercises. Keeps you stupid so they can extract more money from you.

Sells overpriced and uselsss supplements.

Only have 1 water cooler.

Small and cramped toilets.

Only have 1 cable machine.

No specialised calf machine despite feedback.

Hangs a underutilized punching bag on a good pull up bar, rendering it useless.

Spams you stupid promotions before its opening to upsell you even more.

Overall, there’s better gyms out there.

Try:
Anytime Fitness Northpoint City
More poweracks and space and hot chicks that actually lifts. Visual motivation.

Yishun Safra Energy One
Specialized flat, incline and decline bench with 4 cable machines. With chicks that actually lifts too.

Yishun Stadium ActiveSG Gym

Anytime Fitness Wisteria Mall,chigen wing,5,"Hi Samuel, thank you for your feedback!

We’re really sorry to hear that your recent gym experience didn’t meet your expectations. Let us share some context that might help:
 1. Peak Hours: Our busiest time is typically between 7:00 PM and 9:30 PM, and we understand this can make the gym feel crowded. Our team encourages all members to be mindful and share space—sometimes a polite request can go a long way 😊

 2. Ventilation: We’ve recently addressed and resolved the ventilation issues, and it’s now functioning well. That said, during peak hours, higher occupancy can naturally cause the room to feel a bit warmer.

 3. Zumba Class Volume: We hear your concern about the volume during our once-a-week Zumba class. While it’s a high-energy session loved by many of our members, we’ll certainly review the sound levels to find a better balance for everyone.

We really appreciate your feedback and hope you’ll consider visiting during our quieter hours for a more comfortable workout experience. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to our team if there’s anything else we can do to help!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMV0UwNlAtMDgyRnh3RRAB
