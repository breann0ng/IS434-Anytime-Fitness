Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Joel Leong,5,"Fantastic gym that has all you need for a good workout!

They have rarely seen equipment like the seated dip and perfect squat machine.

Machines here are by Matrix. Low crowd on a weekday afternoon. Gym was clean and comfortable. Will be back!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIOGZPdGF3EAE
Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Ertiza Abbas,5,"If you're tired of soulless sweat factories, run (or saunter, no rush) to Anytime Fitness Lower Pierce. It's transformed my ""ugh, exercise"" into ""yes, this is my happy place."" Five stars aren't enough. Thank you for reminding me that wellness can feel this good, this real, this joyful. 💖 #FitnessFamily #LowerPierceLove #AnyTimeFitness #Singapore",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25CcVJ6RjVhMWhEVlc1WVowTTRVV2hSVUVsNGRsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Sihan Goi,4,"Dropped by on a Tuesday afternoon and it was rather quiet. The gym is small, but is quite new and neat, and also has pretty much all the equipment I need for a good workout, especially in the free weights section. 1 rack, 1 small platform, 2 Ziva barbells that spin, 2 sets of coloured bumper plates, other rubberized plates. There are some specialty bars too - 1 short bar and 1 safety bar. Lots of plate loaded machines and a few different pulley attachments. Dumbbells up to 50kg. However, there's very little redundancy. For example, only 1 rack, so if someone is benching, you can't squat, and vice versa. It would've been nice if another rack could be squeezed in somewhere - perhaps make it 2 racks + attached platforms and 2 other bars, and remove the existing small platform - not sure if it'll fit but it sure would make it easier to train when it's crowded. There's a locker area but I didn't see if there were shower areas or toilets. Parking is along the road outside or the public carpark just across the street.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYcXFQMEJBEAE
Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Mitcher Pang,5,"Fantastic gym! It's always clean, the equipment is modern, and the atmosphere is motivating. The staff are super friendly and professional.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21oS2VUaFJWbVpNYlhadFYxRkJWelpaZFRGRGVVRRAB

Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,darani daran,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Anytime Fitness in Lower Pierce, Singapore. The gym is spacious and well equipped, providing a wide range of high-quality equipment to cater to different fitness needs. The facility is clean and well maintained, creating a pleasant environment for workouts.

The staff members were friendly and attentive, always ready to assist and offer guidance.

Additionally, the gym's convenient operating hours allowed me to work out at my own pace.

Overall, I highly recommend Anytime Fitness in Lower Pierce for its excellent facilities and welcoming atmosphere....highly recommended",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWdm8tWW5nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Yz Chen,5,"First time joining a gym, and decided on AF at lower pierce as it is the closest outlet to my place. Joined the free trial, and had the help of William. He patiently went through the equipments with me, guiding me through the correct forms and techniques.

The gym is clean, with paper towels and sanitizers to wipe down the machines when needed.

Looking forward to my gym journey with AF @ lower pierce.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsaWZyTTNBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,mathematics science,5,"Very Clean and pleasant environment. Friendly staff , yet not obstrusive. For those who take public transport - it is a tad far from the nearest mass rapid transit (MRT) station. To me, that appeals greatly.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZOUtuS2h3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Trevor Sze,5,"I was on a quest to check out ALL 120+ locations of AF and i now have, and this one is one of my favourites! Despite not being one of those mega sized ones like City Hall or Chai Chee, here at Lower Pierce there's a really nice vibe to it. Machines (though not as extensive as the bigger places) are complete enough, able to target every body part, making it possible for satisfactory workout sessions without much effort to compromise. There is enough space between machines so as to not feel oppressed (like other locations can be). Floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides allow plenty of natural light in, at the same time making it safer to workout at night. The cardio machines face a quiet neighbourhood park while the proximity to the many shophouse eateries and a good hawker centre, makes your gym trip even more pleasant and one you look forward to. Being in a quaint and cozy neighbourhood helps you relax and unwind with a focused workout, unlike the stressful mall and office district locations. This place is well worth a special visit to!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURnc01Xbmd3RRAB

No ventilation. Only 1 toilet to be shared for both genders. Very dirty and smelly. Hope they’ll look into this.

Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Xavier Ng,5,"As I walked into Anytime Fitness Lower Pierce, I was immediately greeted by the friendly and welcoming atmosphere of the gym. The staff, especially Christopher, exuded a genuine sense of warmth and hospitality that instantly put me at ease. Christopher offered to give me a tour of the facility. His knowledge and passion for fitness were evident as he guided me through the state-of-the-art equipment and explained the various workout options available to me. Throughout my workout session, Christopher was always on hand to offer assistance, encouragement, and helpful tips to optimize my fitness routine. His positive attitude and enthusiasm were truly infectious, motivating me to push myself further and achieve my fitness goals. What stood out to me the most was Christopher's genuine care and commitment to ensuring that I had a positive and productive gym experience. Whether it was adjusting my form during exercises or simply checking in to see how I was doing, his personalized attention made me feel valued as a member of the gym community.Thanks to Christopher and the team at Anytime Fitness Lower Pierce, my gym sessions became more than just a workout—they became a source of inspiration and empowerment.

Anytime Fitness Lower Peirce,Toh Hong Rui,2,"Nice gym with very new equipment. Staff is friendly during stuffed hours, but as always for anytime fitness outlets, spoiled by people who either don't bring towels, or don't wipe down the equipment after usage, or worse, both. Makes me also realise why should I be so considerate to bring my towel and wipe down the equipment?

Tip: wiping the equipment before you use them is more important than wiping after usage.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREX3RHd2lBRRAB
