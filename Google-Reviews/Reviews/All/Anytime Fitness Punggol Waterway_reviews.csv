Anytime Fitness Punggol Waterway,Justin Hoyo,4,"Outlet was smaller than I expected, but rather cozy! Dumbbells so up to 40kg, and there were sufficient number of weight plates. The gym was super neat, cleaned, and well-maintained.

Staff here were friendly and helpful. Members can also use the evolt body scanner for free (take note only during staffed hours).

In terms of locations, it’s near the park, but not very convenient to get to, and no shopping malls nearby. But a good thing is that it’s more quiet and less crowded than other gyms.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2twMmVtMWtOVE5HVW5WdE5rZFBlVVp1TjFOMFozYxAB

Anytime Fitness Punggol Waterway,M Ang,4,"Small and cosy Anytime Fitness tucked at a corner in Waterway. Being located right next to a park it feels zen to be working out here. Although the space is small it's quite well utilized and there's a variety of equipments. Space is clean and the weights are tidily placed unlike most of the other outlets where you can't find the plates at the destinated rack.
Free for members to use evolt360 during staffed hours is a bonus.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25wMFFUTkpaRkZ6YzBOR1NuTkRSV3B0TTA1R1JXYxAB

Free weights to machines that are in top-notch condition. You can tell the management really takes pride in keeping the equipment and facilities in great shape.

But what really makes this gym stand out is the staff. They’re friendly, approachable, and always ready to help, whether it’s asking about nutrition or giving small tips to improve form.

Anytime Fitness Punggol Waterway,Jordan Chong,3,"What I like is there are some unique training possibilities with new equipment (in pic1). The gym still have room for least 5 equipments, so hopefully they are able to add based on demand. I was excited to see EVOLT body scanner but I was disappointed that was intentionally locked from self-service usage. I am doubtful of the intent of the gym owner. What's the point if you have equipment but not letting users to use it. For additional income?",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tKblQyaFpla2sxUlRaVldYQkVTR1U1TVV0SlYyYxAB
