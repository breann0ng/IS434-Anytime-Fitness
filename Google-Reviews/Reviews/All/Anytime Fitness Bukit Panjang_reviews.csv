Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,A,4,"Very small neighbourhood gym at BP CC. It’ll be nice if machines for lateral raises and calf extensions can be added. Maintenance of the equipment is good.

Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,LOVE GOD Trust God,5,"I have been training in this gym for almost a year now. Every time I visit this gym during office hours, all the staff and personal trainers are so friendly and nice. That is the reason why there are so many members in this small gym.

Two days ago, all of a sudden, my access pass stopped working and couldn't link to my Google Wallet; therefore, there was no way I could enter the gym after office hours.

Kudos and big thanks to Jolin and all her team members for patiently and skillfully helping me solve and completely resolve my problem. Five stars for tip-top customer service. I am a frequent traveler on SIA business class for work. Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang, Jolin, and her team are on par with SIA's customer service level. Keep up the good work, guys.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOZTF3NmE1cV9TTG5nRRAB

They are really the ones who are bringing the vibes to BP outlet, always friendly and gives a warm welcome to every member that walks in to the gym as well as answering enquiries on whatsapp & in-person like they are really attentive and replies fast, helping members solve any enquiries!!

So happy to have a gym that has such great team members around which makes me feel like im at home whenever i come for my workout, really highly recommended even tho the gym is on the smaller size but they have good equipments that are suffice for a good workout and not forgetting really good community here, be it the staff/members, keep up the good work Jolin & team!!! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VPckc4ckh6MF9XOXFRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,Fiona Zg,5,"Cosy, new-ish gym with well maintained equipment, and the staff and PT are also friendly and helpful. Has most of the basic machines and weights - though it'll be better if they could bring in more kettlebells. Usually gets too crowded in the evenings shortly after office hours, so I try to avoid that timing. Note that there are no lockers -- only open shelves for bags. The toilets are outside the gym (within the community centre) and no shower.

Side note but I like the decorations by the staff whenever there's a festive period! Halloween, Deepavali, Christmas, etc.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCX3NUbXFBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,Cheetong Toh,4,"Visited the gym recently.

Likes
- the place is well lit.  Bright and cheery feel.
- the place is clean.
- the equipments are new and looks well maintained.
- well organized and weights tidily placed.

Dislike (personal opinion)
- smallish area but well organized to maximize the area. good housekeeping and does not feel uncomfortable.
- equipped with most basic machines and stations.  Noticed there is no row machine and no station for deadlift. But not a show stopper.  Maybe due to space constraint.

Generally, there are more likes than dislike.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfeXVqWk9nEAE
Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,Fritz Rehl Ramos Vallarta,5,"Asyraf is truly the best membership consultant I’ve ever met. Within just 2–5 minutes of speaking with him, he understood my concerns and addressed them effectively. He resolved my membership issues on the same day, demonstrating exceptional service that goes above and beyond. Asyraf’s ability to connect with members and prioritize their needs exemplifies the kind of outstanding support we need in this industry. His dedication not only benefits the members but also contributes positively to the business. Having professionals like him in the club creates an environment of happiness and motivation, making workouts something to look forward to. I’m excited about the new experiences ahead at the club!

Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,Dev Kumar,2,"Really underwhelming experience. I really wish Anytime Fitness showed more love to the Bukit Panjang community because the current gym we have is a sad sight. Toilet is outside, smelly with no changing room or shower. Gym space is very small and claustrophobic. Interior lighting and design looks like a old condo gym. It's very clear the franchisee was focused solely on low rental and renovation costs when opening up the place. But I must highlight the staff are friendly and place is kept clean and organized. But overall, should take notes from AF Bukit Timah Central.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0eHZTTzlnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bukit Panjang,Jayvinn Wong,4,"Came on a weekday at 8.30am-10am,  was not crowded with only 2-3 other gymgoers.

As others have reviewed, this is a small gym with no attached toilet facilities. There are 2 half racks, a small dumbbell + bench area, the standard selection of back and leg machines, and a small crossfit area. There is no designated area to deadlift, unless you do it at the dumbbell area or cross fit space (soft flooring though).

Good usage of the limited space, with great cleanliness and lots of cleaning supplies provided.

Will recommend if you can come during off peak, but I'll imagine the limited space to be tedious when it is crowded.",,ChRDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocmI1OBAB

A few things that didn't give it a 5 stars is

I find the staff and fellow gymers accomodating and polite, especially when we had to make space for each other when it got rather crowded later in the evenings. This really took the pain out of the 15 minutes from my flat (and then back),  three or four times a week, doing the weights and joining the strenuous group exercise classes.......lol.

Its been 7 months since I joined.

I lost 3 kg fat and gained 2 kg muscles. This was measured on some weigh machine available at the premise. Also got onto a couple chat-group with other gymers.
