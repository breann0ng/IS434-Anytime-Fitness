Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Keith Ong,4,"Sufficient Equipments for every muscle group with a gym that size. They had Hammer Strength plate loaded machines which are superior to LifeFitness plate loaded ones. The lighting is nice with a cool vibe feeling to it, though it can be a little dark when u first enter. Would visit again.👍 The Renovation was a success. …",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURJb015ZGN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Goh Hong Yi,1,"horrible customer service. the staff here should be replaced ASAP

texted them to cancel my anytime fitness membership as my new office has a gym. they informed me that aug 1 would be my last billing.

then i texted them subsequently to change billing to another credit card, which they ignored after, not even a single reply. so if a customer requests for sth after cancelling, they wont even have the decency to give a proper reply? instead they will just completely ignore, but thats not all

previously the staff mentioned aug 1 is last billing, yet im still billed on sept. means there’s clearly some screw ups, probably the staff didnt even submit cancellation form or something

to higher management, please do sth abt the staff currently managing this gym… horrible customer service, this guy is probably just slacking hes not doing anything

not sure how to include pictures as evidence but reach out to me if you want the whatsapp convo",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xsNE0xZFdZM1ZVVnkxSlFXRlRVMXB3TFdkblNFRRAB
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Wan Xin Tan,1,"Home gym for many years but recently my card was auto terminated by UOB (when i was overseas) & this was how AF does their customer service.

firstly, i was expected to contact vendor myself.

secondly, i was expected to update AF when my flight come back from work trip was already 30/5 AM.

Business dont seem to know the importance of retaining customers. but that's fine, to AF it always seem like its our fault :). Will not recommend any of my friends to sign up here anymore & we are migrating our home gym!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJdWNucGJqbWUyQnVRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,D Ho,3,"I like this outlet (close by my house, tucked away on the second floor of an old neighbourhood mall, not too crowded, new equipment), but my enthusiasm is tempered by poor comms. I've been trying to reach them on WhatsApp for months, but responses have dwindled to almost nothing, so 3 stars from me.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xOeGNUUk9aSFJXWkhWVFpqbFhMV3BqWmpSQlNuYxAB

Anytime Fitness Buangkok,yu jack,1,"1. The gym is overcrowded with excessive equipment, making it feel cramped and hard to move around.
2. The weighing scale has been broken for years and still hasn’t been replaced.
3. Staff are almost impossible to reach, making it difficult to get help when needed.
4. Some equipment is frequently out of order, with repairs seemingly always pending.
5. While joining is straightforward, canceling a membership is extremely frustrating. Staff frequently ignore messages, delay responses, and fail to answer calls during office hours, making the process feel intentionally difficult. They often say you need to contact “another department” for cancellations, but never provide clear contact information, leaving you in the dark about how to end your membership.
6. Each gym is individually owned and managed separately as of what they write on the website, the review above is only for this gym outlet.

If you are looking for a gym with good support, avoid this outlet.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzZ3ZtUXZ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Maung Maung,1,"The gym is over crowded and no cleaning at all .
Most of people are doing recording and took equipment for long time personally.

The staff are also not friendly and using their phones or watching movies on their laptops.

No wet-tissue filling and no WiFi at this branch .

We paid same membership amount to any time fitness but didn’t get the same services like others branches like city hall/ harbor front.

Less equipments and damage on equipment are not repaired for long time as below .
Really disappointed this branch and will not extend the membership.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmb05YdmF3EAE

Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Duncan Lim,5,"This gym stands out as one of the superior options in the area. Their equipment is sourced from reputable brands like Hammer Strength and Life Fitness, which surpasses the quality of Precor. Even if you happen to forget your access card, their staff can manually check you in, ensuring hassle-free entry. Maintaining cleanliness and hygiene is a top priority here, and the cleaning staff does an excellent job. I would recommend this gym for those in search of a top-notch fitness facility.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaeTRXS0hnEAE
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Audrey L,3,"Been gymming here since they opened and maintenance has fallen significantly in the past two years. Open floor area is messy and not cleaned properly. Fans not working, aircon usually kinda hot (sometimes they turn certain units off I presume to save on electricity costs). Toilet is also kinda dirty and smelly. There’s this new phenomenon where the gym seems to have mistaken itself for a club and working out there can feel like you’re in a torture camp. Feedbacked to the manager once and to his credit he did lower the volume but turned it back up after an hour.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0ZzZPM2FBEAE
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Kathleen Salazar,5,"Staff are nice and the equipment is adequate.

As a girl I’m looking for hip thrust machines and abductor machine but there weren’t any here. Just have to make do with the barbells etc. Had a good upper body workout still! Alot of machines but can feel a bit squeezy ONLY A BIT. (but normal in other AFs and ActiveSGs).",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURONzZEV3NnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Shak,1,"I had to cancel my membership, before the first year contract is completed, due to medical reason and the admins had delayed this process with the explanation “management decision to review and approve cancellation may take time”. I have paid subscription for at least 4 months without even entering the facility, out of which 2 months are due to the management delaying to get back to me, and now they ask me to pay 100$ and close. Truly disappointing from such an established brand.

Regarding the facilities itself (Buangkok), when I sign up I was offered 1-hour free PT session, where the trainer taken up my entire hour trying to sell his service than helping me familiarize with basics. I gave this feedback, but not sure if that changes anything. I guess it's just ok ok facilities if you want to do things on your own, and for the first 4 weeks I went there, the equipments were available without waiting between 8 am to 10 am window (don't know about other times)..

Update 05th May 2024: The center had acknowledged that my membership was cancelled after I had paid $100 as early termination fee, however I have noticed in my bank statements that I was charged again for the membership fee in April and May 2024. I had reported this again to their official WhatsApp account in April which they did not respond, and today again where they gave a lame excuse of system issues causing unauthorized charging to my debit card, and I am told the two months fee will be credited back to me. I am glad that I had gone through my statements closely, if I hadn't then Anytime fitness would have continued to charge me.

I hope the anytime fitness upper management take action on this center's unprofessional handling of cancellations.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5Nk91N0ZREAE
Anytime Fitness Buangkok,Yuki Kino,1,"earlier today i made a phone call to the buangkok branch to enquire about my brother's membership issue to know more about the problem and honestly speaking i feel that the staff was very unprofessional.
I only called to enquire and just to check on how to the membership works then afterwards i explain on the membership that my brother had and ask on how to cancel. the man on the phone with me had the audacity to mention that i was blaming  the company when i was just purely asking and explaining about my situation.  the audacity of that staff made me so speechless and disappointed as i was only trying to solve the problem on the cancellation of the membership instead of blaming him BUT he was pointing fingers at me.
Not only that, prior before when my brother sign up for this membership at the midtown outlet, the staff who recommended this contract did NOT highlight the important parts of the contract. I understand that it is part of my brother's fault for not reading the contract BUT as a service provider they should be more professional and highlight the important part of the contract, example like the rules on cancelling the membership and the fact that the membership is auto renew monthly.
ultimately, i hope that all the service provider staffs will be more professional when handling their clients by highlighting all the important points in the contract AND explain more in-depth to avoid confusions like this in the future.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0NHVxTmZ3EAE

Anytime Fitness Buangkok,K O,3,"Visiting this as an Australian Anytime Fitness member. Rather small gym but equipment selection is excellent. There was a wide cable machine in an otherwise tight space (Very happy that this was available!). Not easy to social distance within the confines. One major critique I had was how members would maintain the sanitary conditions of the shared equipment. There were baskets with sanitising spray and microfibre towels attached to the machines. The reusing of these towels was what made me feel extremely uncomfortable. (How often are they washed and replaced?) Most other AFs I had visited in Singapore (and in Australia) use disposable wipes. Yes, they aren’t as environmentally friendly but considering the current pandemic conditions we are in, I suppose that would be a better trade off than the common microfibre towel wipes.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtdFB6bEJ3EAE
