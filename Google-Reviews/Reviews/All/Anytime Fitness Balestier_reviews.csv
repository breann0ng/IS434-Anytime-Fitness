Anytime Fitness Balestier,Chloe Kang,2,"This AF is just too small. During the golden hours around 7 to 8 pm, it gets way too crowded. It really difficult to work out. Plus, they run classes at the same time, so there’s barely any space left for free weights. Honestly, why should I have to worry about the class schedule while I’m trying to work out? I don’t think I’ll be renewing my membership after it ends.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT210eVZUVXphazVHY1U5MlQwMDJlbkpNVEVwZlJrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Peter Mokosch,4,"This gym I used, when on vacation in Singapore. The gym has open 24 hours and has all you need to do your running and weights. The only not so nice thing are the showers, however still get 4 points from me.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pSQ01FaG1VMDVNTkcxR1UyOVhhMlEwWlVoNWVrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Woo Chiao Tay,5,"This is a nice quiet, two level gym. The staff always friendly, greeting me warmly, and enter the door. Have a good self equipment and it’s usually not crowded so you don’t have to wait for equipment.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWMnRTMjR3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Gary Ang,5,"I honestly quite like the place, 30 seconds walk from the carpark, so far none other gym can beat this record! Usually go there in the morning and hence no staff is around. Equipment wise is quite good, 1st floor weights and dumbbell, second floor machines and functional space. Machine brand is from Mprecor. Love the down light btw!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKN01UYjNRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Max,5,"This gym is simply the best. Two racks for squats/bench/deadlift so you always have one available. I prefer to come early in the day, so gym being 24/7 is amazing. Upstairs there is an area to do non-weight exercises and then take a shower (also very nice). The staff and management are friendly and professionaly resolved all my inquiries. The price was also x2.5 less than the gym around the corner. Really couldn’t ask for more, can‘t recommend you guys enough.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4Nk9Yc1pREAE

Anytime Fitness Balestier,Maria Chia,5,"This is a Really a Friendly place, though I'm not a member and not there to exercise (the lazy type)... but my very brief experience there last evening really gave me the feeling that ~ the staff and trainers there are extremely helpful, polite and understanding... .all the best to all of you, and thanks so much for rendering me the help.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5NEpubUNBEAE
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Parvathi k,1,"Been a member for 2 years and notice that the current club manager don't take members feedback seriously. The cleanliness of the equipment, bathroom is very bad. And they only have 2 tv channels to watch, Gym wipes  take 1 month for them to refill it.  and I have to carry my own wet wipes every time I go for workout. Overall membership was not value for money and would not recommend to anyone.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNnamJyRzd3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Oliver Jack,2,"This branch of Anytime Fitness leaves a lot to be desired compared to its counterparts elsewhere in SG. It is not on the same level of cleanliness, with quite a bit of dirt, both on the equipment and throughout the facilities (that upstairs window is terrible). The air conditioning is far too warm — this gym is easily 3-4 degrees warmer than any other location in Singapore — that doesn’t sound like a lot until you’re on the treadmill, drenched in sweat. Finally, the equipment is old and in need of some upgrades (the benches in the weight room are nasty and falling apart, for example). These aren’t to the standards of the other Anytime Fitness locations, throughout the globe or on the island.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvZ05pU1ZnEAE
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Beatrix Yap,5,"My go to place whenever I'm in need of a workout! Clean and spacious, well-equipped and on top of that they provide free classes from Monday to Saturday for all members :) The trainers that they have there are also experienced and friendly too, they're willing to help whenever you have any questions with regards to your fitness goals or diet. Kudos to the team at AF Balestier!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNvZ0lIbXdBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Balestier,K Daron,4,"Overall a good gym

It consists of two levels, first floor has the free weights and cables. Second floor has mostly machines and cardio equipment.

It has all the basic equipments and weights. They have two power racks but no deadlift platform.

Barbells and weight plates are Hampton brand which are likely to be 46lbs which is about 20.86kg slightly heavier and thicker than the usual olympic barbell. The weight plates are also suspected to be in lbs so do take note.

The only downside is that there isnt any additional gym floormats for block deadlifts or to cushion the weights to reduce noise when deadlifting beyond 180kg

They have taken the feedback of adding a traditional cable lat pulldown which is fantastic.

Lighting used to be great many years ago but it has been deteriorating and as such, not as bright as before making the gym look dull and moody.

Overall a good homely gym, staffs are friendly and always willing to help out.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnNnVEUVN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Gus Meyer-Jones,5,"I came to the Balestier anytime for a month while in temporary accommodation at Novena. I was having a bad day the first time I came and want overly excited by the place but I persisted. Gotta keep them gains right? Soon I settled into a nice routine and have ended up loving this place. What are the good things? Plenty of available free weights. It's probably covid related but I never have to queue for equipment. Plenty of variety of free and cable machines. Even a 45degree leg press! Upstairs has a good variety of cable and cardio machines and a big stretching area. It's never too cold in the gym either. What's the point of working out if you don't sweat?
Only negative is the couple of dude sitting playing on their phones playing with their hair, taking selfies and pouting. I might be that guy that deliberately bombs their pics for the sheer hell of it. Sad to be leaving.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHeGM3Z1FREAE
Anytime Fitness Balestier,Thomas Chan,5,"Its those typical AF gym that I've been. I will be bias because this is my home gym. Weights is at lower level and upper is machines like treadmaill, leg press,, pull down etc. I don't think its the biggest I've been but its enough for your own workout. Its typically busy After 7pm to 8pm on weekdays. If you want a quieter environment, come on sunday morning or late evening. But during this pandemic, its only open during staff time, so no more in the middle of the night workout.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM4c3Y3bk9REAE
Anytime Fitness Balestier,vasanth kumar,5,"Overall it's good. Not crowded, Very spacious of two floors and with good number of equipments than few other branches. They run 24 hours every day even during Covid days. Have vending machines and protein bars.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhdXRUTVdBEAE
