Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Salim Essaid,5,"Wonderful staff and friendly local gym.

Other gyms are overpriced, charging up to SG $60 for one time gym use. Anytime Fitness allowed me to use the well equipped gym, their hospitality was a highlight of my trip. Come here if travelling, and also living here.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tWck4yWk5NM0ZVUmxGZlIxUk9XbXMyTmswNE0zYxAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Vidya Kothari,1,"Honestly paying a membership for unclean equipment and toilets is a bit much. There is no upkeep of cleanliness with toilets full of flies and stains of others fluids, even cockroaches. and it has been the same for days, maybe even weeks. I come every morning to the same level of cleanliness; it's a bit much. Please do something about it, if not, what's the point of paying compared to a local, cheaper gym?",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21JMFRXY3laVGxtTURKVlgyTlNOak4zYmtFdFkwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Daniel Ng,3,"A strange AF located right opposite Cantonment Police Station. It's a 4-storey shop house. The 1st level kinda has dungeon vibes, very gritty, low ceilings, 1 squat rack, smith machine, leg press, deadlift platform and dumbbells up to 50kg. L2 has cardio machines and a couple of random plate loaded machines. L3 is all Life Fitness machines with the cable stack as well. At L4 there's a random glute extension and back extension as well as dual pulley cables. Overall it's a little bit small and narrow but decently well equipped. The showers are very tiny though and aren't exactly the cleanest around. Overall a convenient gym if you're in the area but loses a couple stars due to cleanliness/maintenance and inconvenience of the 4-floor layout.

Not ideal for leg day cos you'll have to climb stairs haha.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURkc3RHdnJ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Tarcisus Ho,4,"Been here on two occasions. Once on a Saturday evening and another on a Monday evening. It gets crowded on weekdays evening but it’s really quiet on weekends.

I do not usually patronise the gym but it is a nice experience to gym in a shop house. The gym has four floors and the toilets/shower is located at the end of each floor except the top floor. Equipment is new and in good condition.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNVpQYTdnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Pinyan Gao,1,"The gym manager blocked my access card and has ghosted my emails after already resolving the membership issue

In addition, the bathrooms are not hygienic and the staff are always heating up and eating food in the weights area which is unpleasant to see/smell",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xkb04yczJjbFUyYlhNNVlrSjBORGRXYm0wMFkzYxAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Bear Melon,4,"CBD area and near from MRT
Unique shop house building
Variation of machine( Decline press etc )
Not new , but good maitaned

divided 4 floor , not easy to move
Few racks , not enough free weight space
Limited shower(small and tired)
SO Bad attitude 2Personal trainers

Good for breast ,arm,shoulder training",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrdjRlYndRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Chili Red Arowana,4,"Nice outlet, but the cycle machine abit old have some weird squeaky noise every time I paddle. Toilet shower you have to switch on the heater button is outside the toilet… if you forgot and already naked inside you will have to shower in cold water… overall nice outlet, 6-8pm not too crowded",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2cVlPUUZREAE
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Aless Leong,3,"The gym underwent Renovation and the lightning and mood feels like a hotel stay. Though the ambience is calm but it makes you sleepy and no motivation to gym. Equipments are still the same and some dumbbells are stained with white paint? Toilets are the same as before, no deep cleaning either.
Only plus point is when cooling down at level 4 you can feel zen and peaceful as it sets the mood (minus the gym music, doubt it’s even Spotify, horrible taste in music)",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3N1BUdDV3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Andy Low,5,Well equipped and clean gym! Friendly staff and members over there made the weight lifting experience great.

Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,David (Bingobob),5,"A well equipped gym with a wide range of equipment suitable for all type of workouts whether it be circuit training, resistance training, cardio  or even yoga, there is space and equipment for you.

Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Yully Yyyy,5,"Anytime Fitness Cantonment is seriously the best. Not only is it large and spacious, the toilet smells nice compared to other AF branches which I appreciate a lot. The weights are always kept and things are always packed neatly and organized. You'll be spoiled coming to this AF and would not want to go anywhere else. (+ the people here are nice)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaNmFxWEtnEAE
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,TRaV N,5,"Well equipped and neat! With a wide range of knowledgable trainers.

An entire private level with huge mirrors for classes and functional training.

The most unique anytime fitness in Singapore situated inside a conservation shophouse.

Don't be fooled from the outside..it is relatively big inside with 4 different levels!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwX2VIU3BBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Noh Danial,5,Conveniently located near the mrt. Just 1-2mins walk away from the station exit. Equipment are well maintained and has many levels. Love the spacious open area (dedicated level) for rope work and various functional trainings. Toilet is also very clean and maintained.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwX1ptQ2hnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,san chua,4,"Very near MRT station hence it’s very convenient.

Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Nithi Tangsirisap,4,Surprisingly quite quiet in the morning of weekdays. Not so crowded on weekends during the days as well. It's quite an experience going to a gym in a shop house like this one. I'm impressed how they manage to squeeze all these equipments in such a tiny space quite efficiently.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSZzQ3UmRREAE
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Alan Hsu,3,"Very small space to the point it becomes somewhat unsafe, 4 floors means difficult to superset or giant set between barbells and machines. Bells are dusty and no alcohol wipes or sprays. I visited between 3-4:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon, only a few people but some were eating on the machines while talking very loudly, prob due to the very small space. Recommend Tiong Bahru or even queensway is better than this branch.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNadE1XczJRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,ayam kampung,3,"Equipments are new and clean. But the gym itself is small and packed. Been visiting during the supposedly “off peak” hour but still got too many ppl especially at the free weight area. It can also get so hot inside, as only one third of air cons r turned on
NB. half of the machines cant be used due to safe distancing measure.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNDOXAzVnNBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Kimberly Dickson,2,"Great gym and facilities, terrible taste in music. Tuneless hard style and eurotrash blasts throughout the place. If you want music induced anxiety, this is the gym for you.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUdnI2S2t3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Jasmine B,5,"Best AF I have visited so far with really nice space and facilities. Staffs and PTs like are extremely knowledgeable and friendly, always available to help.
Spanning across 4 levels also means that not everything is cramped together, allow walking space and a little private “me time” at different machines.
Will always return for my weekly workout, good job AF Cantonment!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cGZmYzdRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Wei Chan,5,"Gym equipment is comprehensive, clean and well maintained and it is not over crowded. Conveniently located right next to Outram MRT. Affordable membership prices as well. Highly recommend",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwMHZDQ0lREAE
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,K Daron,5,"It's a great gym that has a total of 4 levels.

Basement level is where most of the strength equipments are at and they have a single power rack and a deadlift platform. Dumbbells ranges from 1kg-50kg.

First level has cardio machines and some hammer strength machines.

Second level has most of the life fitness machines. They also have the multi-jungle equipment.

Top level has another jungle equipment set. There is also another cable machine with lots of cardio equipments (Rope, TRX, abs roller, box, etc)

Overall I'll rate it as a good gym. It is usually not that crowded but when it does, it may be quite troublesome because theres only one power rack.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURJZ1phVEF3EAE
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Christopher Bobin,5,"I've gone to a number of AnyTime Fitness outlets in Singapore: this one works for me and is one of the best in my opinion.  Four floors in a shophouse provides decent scale and a wide range of equipment.  Staff is courteous and not intrusive.  There are trainers available if that's what you require; otherwise, they leave you alone. A nice mix of local and expat clients, centrally located near the Outram MRT station gives it a nice vibe.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2dkkzNnpnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Jaycee LS,1,"This isn't as great as what others says on their review.

Pros:
4 levels of space.
Number of equipments.

Cons:
RUDE AND HOSTILE STAFFS.
Dark.
Whining PTs and members.
Rusty bars.
Feels like maze.
Members bang and drops heavy equipment resulting to shaky floor.
Staff, PTs, and members eat food in the equipment.

Recommendations:
Better go to other branches like Tanjong Pagar or Keppel where equipments are better and brighter.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaHBYaXRRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Cantonment Road,Ryan Davis Ng,1,"Absolutely awful feel to this club. As other reviews say…a hostile feel.
