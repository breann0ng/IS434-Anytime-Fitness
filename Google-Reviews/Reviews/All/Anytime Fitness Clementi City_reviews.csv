Anytime Fitness Clementi City,shawn Jay,3,"Greg is hands down one of the best trainers I’ve ever met. He genuinely listens and cares about progress. He has been outstanding as a coach and motivator.

Shawn is awesomely approachable, encouraging, and knowledgeable.

Trainers like Shawn Shawn are the reason members still have faith in this gym. But know this, you lost gold.

The manager, instead of motivating or helping, she creates an environment of tension and negativity.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Clementi City,farah syed,1,"The trainers at Clementi City are hardworking and approachable, but the manager, Norliah Abu, is the biggest disappointment in this gym. Zero professionalism, zero empathy, and full of attitude. Every interaction feels like she’s doing you a favor by even acknowledging you. She is harsh, rude, and seems to enjoy belittling members. The environment feels cold and hostile under her leadership. The gym was supposed to be a place where I could regain focus and stay positive. Instead, the manager at Clementi City made the experience unbearable. Her lack of empathy, condescending tone, and complete disregard for member well-being pushed me further down when I needed support the most. I hope Anytime Fitness takes this seriously, because no member should be treated this way.

I strongly urge Anytime Fitness HQ to review her position, because she is damaging the reputation of the brand and driving away good people.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Jessie Liau,1,"horrible experience with this outlet - machines are limited, powerlifters doing 10 sets on their phone rather than actually lifting, hogging racks the entire session.

worst one yet - middle aged chinese trainer is really rude and disrespectful of other club members. just because he’s a trainer, he demands occupied machines from others who are already in the midst of using it. i don’t mind sharing, but he didn’t respect my rest time. my timer was up as well and it was clearly my turn to go again after his client, instead he insisted on going again just because his “timer” was also up - as if mine didn’t matter.

it’s my first time coming across a personal trainer (usually well respected) like this (in this case they’re not). been to many outlets from north to central, other trainers wouldn’t even ask to share machines and would feel ashamed to disrupt your workout, although i would be happy to share with respect.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Sheryl Wan,5,Just checking out prices. Was running 11.11 promo - No joining fee. Although space was not as spacious compared to another nearby fitness club but enough for a gym enthusiast. Do what you need to do and get out.

Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Ho Hweeying,1,"I will not be giving even a star! This is the worst service I have ever received. I was charged a failed payment fee of $15.26 due to an issue with auto-debit. This occurred because I had to cancel my card immediately after it was compromised, and the cancellation coincidentally fell close to the auto-billing date, resulting in the failed payment fee. I contacted AF via text and email to request a waiver of the fee, but I was told it could not be waived as the fee was generated by EZYPAY (the system AF uses for billing). This is ridiculous!

Despite this, I made my payment through PayNow, as I have not yet received my new card. I sent them proof of the payment via WhatsApp, and they replied, 'Your membership still has an outstanding balance for this month.'

Correct me if I'm wrong, but can I interpret this to mean that since the payment was made via PayNow or any other method besides auto-debit, AF will have to manual update the system. Does this also mean they can waive the failed payment fee if they are willing to.

I would say AF is taking granted of our membership. They are not even appreciate their members. We are paying our membership fee every single month, without us signing up as member, AF is nothing!

TLDR: AF is a money-sucking gym with ZERO empathy",Date not found

A special shoutout to Trainer Sean, who has been a great help in getting over my fear with certain workouts and in achieving my fitness goals while always being mindful of my condition/injury. I have also gained valuable insights and perspectives from his knowledge sharing on training & diet. From my experience of benefitting from Sean's personalized program, I would highly recommend him to anyone who plans to collaborate with a PT regardless of their goals.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Kay,5,"I am a regular in Clementi Anytime fitness since 2020 till date. Gym is equipped with large variety of exercise machine to target every muscle groups. It also includes 3 squats/bench press racks, a smith machine and a dedicated deadlift platform to cater peak crowd. The gym has 4 washrooms with shower facilities, which is very handy for people who workout in the morning and head to work/school from gym.

The most valuable aspect I had from Clementi AF was Sean Lim’s absolute professional personal training/coaching. I met Sean in late 2020, after a slip-disc injury. Sean encouraged focusing on overall strength rather than giving up. And we set goal to improve muscle strength and overall aesthetics.

Sean’s Approach:

1. Form Correction
* Prioritized proper form over quick progression
* Addressed pre-existing bad habits in exercises
* Resolved strength imbalances through altered routines

2. Progress Management
* Set realistic, achievable targets for both body weight/body fat as well as for exercise weight
* Monitored achievements
* Helped break through plateaus
* Built my confidence and self-belief

3. Adaptability
* Modified routines around injuries/sickness, or during busy periods at work
* Provided sports therapy when needed
* Created enjoyable, varied workouts

4. Nutrition Guidance
* Identified and permanently eliminated some unhealthy calorie sources, and replaced some others with cleaner ones
* Introduced concepts of macros, cutting, and bulking and helped me master them
* Guided on meal preparation, even if I have busy schedules with work

Key Achievements
1. Significant strength improvements:
* Barbell bench press: 60kg → 85kg (6 reps)
* Barbell squats: 70kg → 105kg (5 reps)
* Conventional deadlifts: 80kg → 140kg (5 reps)
2. Reached sub-10% body fat",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Yihao Poh,5,"Visited this gym for about a month plus now. The equipment there are well equipped and well maintained. Not really crowded, love the atmosphere and environment. A great place to workout 👍
Encountered an issue today with the staff in the evening, but she was very friendly and professional. Instead of chasing us out, she explained to us patiently as she knew my friend and I didn't know about the rules in the gym. She also told us that if we ever need help we can approach them, as they have professional trainers who is experienced and well educated on fitness.
Really appreciate the professionality and friendliness 👍",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Michelle Elzira,2,"I've been to numerous Anytime Fitness outlets. Despite small sizes and all, the centres are generally functional.

Imagine my shock when I came to this centre, and realise that most of the lockers are  non-functional. The lockers come with latches for the lock .. but out of the many lockers, I counted about 5 with latches, and the rest without. What's the point of having lockers if I cannot lock my valuables?

The toilets are not the cleanest, and I think it can be much better. I believe much can be done to improve this outlet, in spite of its age.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Natalie Tay,3,"With this gym, you can really exercise anytime. The staff is great, friendly, and the people are, too.

As a gym, the facility is small but you can pretty much do anything there. It tends to get very crowded probably due to the cheaper fees. The restrooms are unlike typical larger gyms and while sufficient, can be quite underwhelming.

Five stars for price and convenience, minus two for small and crowded space, and loud music.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Clementi City,Godwin Koh,5,"Look no further if you are into a gym that is inclusive and not intimidating at all. So many friendly people coming from a wide range of background. From old to young. From experienced to the ""newbie"".

The gym is also quite big, with an open space that is frequently used to hold classes (If you are into this sort of perks).

Its also one of the few rare gym that offers an entire bathroom suite for us to shower instead of cubicles. It makes the whole place even more cosy.

If you are into the connection with the staff, fret not, look out for Elene! She gave a very well tailored explanation when i was signing up, very understanding to my situation as a student and was able to wait for my decision without being intrusive.

From what i can see,  the PTs are very engaging and they would often put in the extra effort to make sure their client pushes to their hardest.

All good times with minimal fuss.",Date not found

The staff works out daily, with his girlfriend, and oftentimes I see him opening doors for some people without keycards, which  iI believe is against company policy.
