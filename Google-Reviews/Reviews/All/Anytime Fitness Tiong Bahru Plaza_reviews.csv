Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Tropical_storm X,3,"Newly opened in 2019, relatively spacious for an Anytime Fitness gym. Location is good, being situated above Tiong Bahru MRT. I Like the squarish open design but sadly, the gym only has 3 shower facilities and NO toilets. You have to walk out of the gym and use the toilets at the shopping mall! For a 24hours gym, there are NO toilets when the mall is closed. So for that, just 3 stars.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Prahlad Kunalan,5,"It’s a great gym that’s just missing a hamstring machine but that’s alright. Recently they have been getting several young punk visitors who have been annoying the rest of the regular gym goers by making lots of noise, sitting on the dumbbell rack, pushing each other and almost hitting another gym user who was just walking past.

I want to commend Samantha who told them off several times to the best of her ability. I can anticipate this group causing more problems that may lead to a safety incident in the near future.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,WanderWithWit,4,"I rarely visit this gym but every time I am here, this place is always consistently clean all thanks to the uncle always seen cleaning in the background. The equipment in this gym are quite well maintained. However, I need to go to the toilet quite often so there is a slight convenience to go to the toilet at the back of the mall.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Jhia Huei Gan,5,"Although membership isn't cheap, I find it worthwhile for the convenience of having a really clean and comprehensive gym in the neighbourhood.  Also, here's a big shoutout to all the users of this gym who make it a pleasant place to be even when it's super crowded at dinner time.  The users here are generally very considerate; there is no slamming of weights and seats are often wiped down after use.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Matthew Wong,3,"- too packed on weekday nights
- no toilet in the branch
- average facilities",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Dylan,4,"Average size gym, very crowded during weekdays after work hours.

Toilet and bathroom is lacking, there is only 3 unisex bathroom(showers only) and 1 female bathroom. I noticed females don't even use the female only bathroom, so sometimes have to queue for the bathroom.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Antoine R,5,"Typical Anytime Fitness, quite small but there’s all the equipment you need. Gym is well located and clean.
The equipment is pretty new and works well, mostly Life Fitness brand and some Hammer Strength (the racks), both very good brands.

No toilets inside the gym",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Rachel Burke,2,"So humid inside all the time, there are so many air conditioning units and only 1-2 in whole gym switched on, not only that but the fans are also never switched on.
Gym membership in SG ain’t cheap, should at least have air con.
Overwhelming sickly smell from a diffuser at the entrance, makes me feel sick while training.
Loads of passive aggressive signage around the gym and no toilet inside.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Philip Jury,4,"I loved my time here. The staff were friendly and the equipment is great. Try to avoid late evening if you want a quieter time there.

Unfortunately Anytime Fitness partner with Ezypay. A predatory payments company who charge you late payment fees after one failed payment and have been known to continue charging you after cancellation at Anytime. Please be careful when engaging with a contract with Anytime while they continue to work with Ezypay.

UPDATE: I’ve dropped this from 3 to 2 as even though I called the gym to let them know I wanted to cancel in December I have still been charged for January and February. Depending upon the response will depend upon whether I drop this further.

UPDATE 1: Sooooo my contract is up in February…which means I’m obliged to pay for January and February. Their response was measured and backed by evidence. So mainly just feel embarrassed right now. However due to their response I figured they earned an extra star.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,A T,4,"4-Star for the gym, 5-Star for the staff (all very helpful and friendly), 1-Star for the yoga instructor.

I've been practicing yoga for several years in Singapore and Hong Kong. I always attend yoga classes with humbleness, a calm mind and respect to the instructors and other students; the session I had with Serena (of this gym) is unforgettably horrifying, I've never encountered any yoga/ fitness instructor this rude, I even wondered if she's even paid to conduct lessons here, what makes her hate her job and her new students that much.

I wanted to walk out of her class just 1 minute after she started the class, she wouldn't stop insulting students, but I told myself to not judge too quickly and don't be rude to walk out, but I regretted it, I should have walked out, she doesn't deserve my respect as she does not respect her students either.

Please don't let her teach there anymore, she does not deserve the position, she is definitely not professional.

I really think the owner of this gym needs to be told about what this yoga instructor does to his clients.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,amazon fire,1,"Great gym where i regularly attend classes at and enjoy however, the yoga class taught by Serena is simply terrible. She is rude and is unable to smile. So much for the emotional wellbeing that should be expressed through yoga. But apart from that the gym is really great and the staffs are friendly. ADVICE don't go for the Yoga class.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Buddhinath Hangawatta,5,"Very spacious, well maintained, well equipped gym.
They recently added a weight lifting platform as well. Have 3 squat racks for your free weight - barbell movements and all kinds of key machines for the isolated movements.
The gym also has a variety of stretch bands, kettlebells, rowing machine, ski erg, and an assault bike.

If you are in to calisthenics or crossfit, what you might find missing are the wallballs, climbing rope, hanging rings, and parallettes.

Loved going to this gym every day for the 4 months I was around.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Cheryl,5,"Tiong Bahru Plaza AF is best outlet out of all AF branches in my opinion. Spacious gym with very new and well maintained equipment, extremely clean, and conveniently located at Tiong Bahru Plaza which is where the MRT is, and the mall itself has many shops including eateries and a supermarket. Gym is open 24 hours and membership price is super affordable.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Z,4,Would have been the perfect gym if there were toilets in the gym. Great variety of machines and decent crowd. Can get quite full on weekday nights.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Fazil Akbar,5,The new intern Jared Tan at Tiong Bahru is very solid. I even worked out with him once and he is a very knowledgeable person. He is also very welcoming as he greets everyone that enters the gym and is always there to help with anyone in the gym.,Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Tony Z,1,"I was “automatically transferred” to Tiong Bahru Anytime fitness, despite I still went to Paya Lebar one. It was transferred without my consent or without me knowing. Ever since transferred to TBR gym, it no longer sent me notification about gym payments. While I knew I didn’t opt-in for “auto-renewal” of contract, I thought my contract would be terminated by Oct, or before Oct. i just found out that a deduction of gym membership from my bank transaction on 2 Nov. As I called the gym staff, she mentioned the auto-renewal would be automatically chosen from the gym transfer.
So basically, anytime fitness can do gym transfer & help customers choose auto-renewal of contracts without informing customers. And she said it was done automatically by the system. If I chose to terminate the contract, I need to give 30-day notice period.
Yesterday I made the call, she said she was alone in the gym, it was understaffed, and would give me response by last night. However, it did not. WhatsApp messages were just blue ticked without replies.
When I tried to call the gym to resolve the issue today, the gym has yet picked up the call.
From these incidents, definitely a poor service rating. It is not customer centric at all.
Maybe my last resort would be turn to lodging a business complaint or report for the unauthorized transactions. If anyone has any suggestions, thank you in advance.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Cris,5,"I like going back always on this gym.

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Zhi Yu Teh,4,"Newly established outlet with plenty of machines and two squat racks which means you don't have to wait too long for your turn.

There are many cardio machines including treadmills and an assault bike which is a rarity in Singapore gyms which means you can get creative with your workouts.

One thing that can be improved on is to add an additional barbell so that people can deadlift without making one rack useless as there are only two barbells and two racks.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Jerry Aaron,4,well known chain of fitness gym outlets.  best selling point is it's 24 hour opening time. membership price is generally lower than the more upmarket gyms so don't expect red carpet stuff. but great convenient location (walking distance from tiong bahru mrt) the next closest branch is down the road at valley point (much larger space),Date not found
