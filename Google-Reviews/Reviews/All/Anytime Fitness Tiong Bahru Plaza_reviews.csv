Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Tropical_storm X,3,"Newly opened in 2019, relatively spacious for an Anytime Fitness gym. Location is good, being situated above Tiong Bahru MRT. I Like the squarish open design but sadly, the gym only has 3 shower facilities and NO toilets. You have to walk out of the gym and use the toilets at the shopping mall! For a 24hours gym, there are NO toilets when the mall is closed. So for that, just 3 stars.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNNcFlmMlp3EAE

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Prahlad Kunalan,5,"It’s a great gym that’s just missing a hamstring machine but that’s alright. Recently they have been getting several young punk visitors who have been annoying the rest of the regular gym goers by making lots of noise, sitting on the dumbbell rack, pushing each other and almost hitting another gym user who was just walking past.

I want to commend Samantha who told them off several times to the best of her ability. I can anticipate this group causing more problems that may lead to a safety incident in the near future.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNnLXE2VzBnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Dylan,4,"Average size gym, very crowded during weekdays after work hours.

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Antoine R,5,"Typical Anytime Fitness, quite small but there’s all the equipment you need. Gym is well located and clean.
The equipment is pretty new and works well, mostly Life Fitness brand and some Hammer Strength (the racks), both very good brands.

No toilets inside the gym",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLN3BlNnR3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Rachel Burke,2,"So humid inside all the time, there are so many air conditioning units and only 1-2 in whole gym switched on, not only that but the fans are also never switched on.
Gym membership in SG ain’t cheap, should at least have air con.
Overwhelming sickly smell from a diffuser at the entrance, makes me feel sick while training.
Loads of passive aggressive signage around the gym and no toilet inside.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWaXVTVGN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Philip Jury,4,"I loved my time here. The staff were friendly and the equipment is great. Try to avoid late evening if you want a quieter time there.

Unfortunately Anytime Fitness partner with Ezypay. A predatory payments company who charge you late payment fees after one failed payment and have been known to continue charging you after cancellation at Anytime. Please be careful when engaging with a contract with Anytime while they continue to work with Ezypay.

UPDATE: I’ve dropped this from 3 to 2 as even though I called the gym to let them know I wanted to cancel in December I have still been charged for January and February. Depending upon the response will depend upon whether I drop this further.

UPDATE 1: Sooooo my contract is up in February…which means I’m obliged to pay for January and February. Their response was measured and backed by evidence. So mainly just feel embarrassed right now. However due to their response I figured they earned an extra star.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQta1lUd3NRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,A T,4,"4-Star for the gym, 5-Star for the staff (all very helpful and friendly), 1-Star for the yoga instructor.

I've been practicing yoga for several years in Singapore and Hong Kong. I always attend yoga classes with humbleness, a calm mind and respect to the instructors and other students; the session I had with Serena (of this gym) is unforgettably horrifying, I've never encountered any yoga/ fitness instructor this rude, I even wondered if she's even paid to conduct lessons here, what makes her hate her job and her new students that much.

I wanted to walk out of her class just 1 minute after she started the class, she wouldn't stop insulting students, but I told myself to not judge too quickly and don't be rude to walk out, but I regretted it, I should have walked out, she doesn't deserve my respect as she does not respect her students either.

Please don't let her teach there anymore, she does not deserve the position, she is definitely not professional.

I really think the owner of this gym needs to be told about what this yoga instructor does to his clients.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNzdzZYVElnEAE
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,amazon fire,1,"Great gym where i regularly attend classes at and enjoy however, the yoga class taught by Serena is simply terrible. She is rude and is unable to smile. So much for the emotional wellbeing that should be expressed through yoga. But apart from that the gym is really great and the staffs are friendly. ADVICE don't go for the Yoga class.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjNnB1MEtBEAE
Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Buddhinath Hangawatta,5,"Very spacious, well maintained, well equipped gym.
They recently added a weight lifting platform as well. Have 3 squat racks for your free weight - barbell movements and all kinds of key machines for the isolated movements.
The gym also has a variety of stretch bands, kettlebells, rowing machine, ski erg, and an assault bike.

If you are in to calisthenics or crossfit, what you might find missing are the wallballs, climbing rope, hanging rings, and parallettes.

Loved going to this gym every day for the 4 months I was around.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKNk1IWEF3EAE

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Cheryl,5,"Tiong Bahru Plaza AF is best outlet out of all AF branches in my opinion.

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Fazil Akbar,5,The new intern Jared Tan at Tiong Bahru is very solid. I even worked out with him once and he is a very knowledgeable person.

Anytime Fitness Tiong Bahru Plaza,Tony Z,1,"I was “automatically transferred” to Tiong Bahru Anytime fitness, despite I still went to Paya Lebar one. It was transferred without my consent or without me knowing. Ever since transferred to TBR gym, it no longer sent me notification about gym payments. While I knew I didn’t opt-in for “auto-renewal” of contract, I thought my contract would be terminated by Oct, or before Oct. i just found out that a deduction of gym membership from my bank transaction on 2 Nov. As I called the gym staff, she mentioned the auto-renewal would be automatically chosen from the gym transfer.
So basically, anytime fitness can do gym transfer & help customers choose auto-renewal of contracts without informing customers. And she said it was done automatically by the system. If I chose to terminate the contract, I need to give 30-day notice period.
Yesterday I made the call, she said she was alone in the gym, it was understaffed, and would give me response by last night. However, it did not. WhatsApp messages were just blue ticked without replies.
When I tried to call the gym to resolve the issue today, the gym has yet picked up the call.
From these incidents, definitely a poor service rating. It is not customer centric at all.
Maybe my last resort would be turn to lodging a business complaint or report for the unauthorized transactions. If anyone has any suggestions, thank you in advance.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMmZDanhRRRAB

There are many cardio machines including treadmills and an assault bike which is a rarity in Singapore gyms which means you can get creative with your workouts.

One thing that can be improved on is to add an additional barbell so that people can deadlift without making one rack useless as there are only two barbells and two racks.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVMzdUazd3RRAB
