Anytime Fitness Marymount CC,Always love,5,"I visited this gym on a weekday noon for a few hours, and I was pleasantly surprised! Despite the mixed reviews, I found the experience to be really positive. I've tried a few different gyms in the area, but I chose to stay here because of the unique vibe. If you're looking to get fit and fitter, I highly recommend Ms Miza - she's an excellent trainer who works well with her clients. As you get to know her, you'll grow to appreciate her approach and personality. Give it a try!

Good clean environment and clean music choice for the day too!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VMSzh4cGV1bHV6RFF3EAE
Anytime Fitness Marymount CC,Jadon,1,"No follow-up on an incorrect charge on credit card. Greatly disappointed in Miza's conduct as she was highly unprofessional. Not only did she fail to follow up on a simple request, but she also ignored messages many times and resorted to sending auto-generated replies to avoid answering questions. Overall 1/10 service.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tnNFdFMVFMVlk1YURGZmNVUnFUSFJYZERZMGNHYxAB

Anytime Fitness Marymount CC,Sihan Goi,1,"Stay away from this outlet unless you enjoy lifting in an environment that prohibits any noise at all, being secretly filmed by the manager, being complained about behind your back, and having a trainer who is more busy being a Karen than coaching you.

This used to be my home club. I signed up with AF here when covid struck as it was the best AF that was near my home. The outlet is quite small, the equipment wasn't anything special, but it was sufficient, and they were very chill.

For a few years it was good. Then a couple years ago, the gym manager changed to this Malay lady who for some reason can't stand the sound of people working out (makes one question her career choice). She started approaching me when I was working out to tell me to not lift so loudly - I do Olympic lifts, but I never ever dump/slam the weights. However, I also don't treat the bar like I'm putting a sleeping baby into a cot. One time, she came up to me to confront me, saying she's sick of hearing noise in the gym. She then lied that a member compained about me one day - I know she lied because I wasn't even at the gym that day. As I tried to reason with her, it became clear she wasn't interested and just wanted things her way. She even started berating the ""posture"" of my lifts (she meant form) and saying she's a certified PT so she knows what she's talking about, even though I've been lifting years before she even stepped foot in a gym.

Anyway, I switched to a new gym (AF New Upper Thomson) as they upgraded over the years and it's nearer my home, so I stopped visiting AFMM. I recently visited AFMM as I was in the area, and doing my lifts as usual, and lo and behold, I see her again. She was with a client, but she found it more important to secretly video me. I paid no attention to her as I knew I was not flouting any gym rules nor doing anything wrong, though it was an invasion of privacy being filmed secretly - just imagine if it was a male trainer secretly filming a female member.

A few hours later I got a WA message from my home club AFNUT saying AFMM snitched on me to them about me allegedly slamming the weights and being too noisy. I told them I wasn't doing any of them and I myself have video evidence of my lifts, to which they agreed with me but that different outlets have different rules (which means the Malay manager must've sent the videos to them).",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tFeVVFaFplalpWYWpGNFJEUkRZV0V6Y1hCeVVIYxAB

Anytime Fitness Marymount CC is bright and extremely functional. While its floorspace is likely one of the smaller branches, it provides a pleasant visit during off peak hours. I will probably avoid after-work hours (and its crowd).",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyN2F5RURREAE

Anytime Fitness Marymount CC,Alyssa (TYLA),1,"Started out fine but got progressively worse over time. Staff were helpful and friendly in the first few years of the gym, but with new management became less responsive and less helpful. Promises to call to resolve matters were not followed up on. Agreements made with past management were not honoured without notice. Messages sent were not followed up on. The only thing they were responsive on was harassing you into taking up PT packages. Considering that I typically gym outside of staffed hours and have no further interactions it’s quite sad.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2cm8zakF3EAE

Anytime Fitness Marymount CC,Ken R,3,"Gym is ok and members/staff are generally pleasant. Not the most well equipped AF gym out there, but lots of variety considering the space available is not very big.

Only issue is this group of gym users (probably in their early 20s?) that usually turn up at night, being all rowdy and shouting vulgarities everywhere. Not sure if anyone has complained but this has been going on for quite a while, and as far as I know, happens during unstaffed hours so I'm not even sure who can put a stop to this behaviour.

No aircon, no music, no fans, no treadmills working. You’re working out in a sauna and after you call the ‘emergency’ hotline, they send a staff down EARLIEST 1h after your call to fix the problem. Then they assure you with a Chat-GPT (corporate edition) generated response that they are trying their best to solve the issue (this was after the first time it happened…only for it happen twice more again). Assured us that an electrician had already came down to address the issue - what we need aren’t reassurances or promises, we need you to ACTUALLY solve the issue.

Anytime Fitness Marymount CC,Arthur Chong,1,"I have been with Anytime Fitness for over 3 years, and sad to say, I have never been so dissapointed with the gym before.

The incident happened on the of 19th July, CB was already lifted. While working out, three members did not practice proper gym etiquette and safe distancing measures. As I started to get really uncomfortable as times are very sensitive, I told the three members to practice social distancing, and to my horror, one of the members started raising his voice and got hostile towards me. I approached a staff named Izan for help. Whilst we were in the midst of resolving the issue in a civilised manner, Izan became hostile and started pointing his finger in my face. This was for no apparent reason. This is totally unacceptable and I made a formal complaint that very night.

The next day, I received a phone call from the director, Emma. Although she was very apologetic, she gave me many excuses to protect her staff; he is still on training, they were short handed and he volunteered to do the night shift alone. The problem is, why wasn't anyone on the floor to ensure that safe distancing measures are in place, or any staff taking initiative to assist me when another member was trying to pick a fight? I am very grateful that gyms reopening and Marymount anytime fitness is one of the few gyms that opens 24 hours, but I feel what goes on in the management should be none of my concern and I shouldn't be 'asked' to empathize. Emma also mentioned that Izan would receive a warning letter. As I expressed to her that it wasn't enough as my saftey was greatly compromised at the gym and I am uncomfortable going back, she replied 'what do you want me to do, terminate him?' I do not expect him to be terminated, but receive a harsh enough punishment to prevent these things from happening again, to protect the safely of all gym goers. She then went on to say that I should give Izan a week to cool down because he is upset he got a warning letter before getting him to personally apologize to me.

She went on the tell me that she will be carrying out an investigation against the three members. I did mention to her that the issue with the three members and I have been resolved and both parties apologized to each other as it was a misunderstanding. My complaint was against the gym and it's management, but she still insist she wants to carry out an investigation on the three other members.

12 days later, almost 2 weeks and no news from Emma. I sent a few emails and she only replied one, stating that she doesn't mind a meet up with Izan and I, and that she is busy as mentioned over the phone on 20th July and she needs time. I found that to be very rude and that she is not taking the matter seriously.

I would just like to give a special mention to a staff named Dian. She was very professional in handling everything. The only saving grace really. Had it not been for her, the whole initial incident might have come to blows.

I am still very affected by the incident till this day, and very dissapointed with the management. For the safety of all AF gym members, it seems like AF marymount is one to avoid.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ4LTZLNWZ3EAE
