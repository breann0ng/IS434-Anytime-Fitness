Anytime Fitness Stevens,janwar soeheri,4,Gym is well equipped for your workout. They have a few machines which are not available in other AF I visited. Like the open space and pool to relax after workout. Will visit more often if around the area.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xGcVR6QXRRakpRY1hZMFNVa3daVlJHYjB0Q1dVRRAB
Anytime Fitness Stevens,david churchill,3,"The cardio room is quite dark and there is no ez bar at the gym.

Anytime Fitness Stevens,Priya Sathiyan,5,"Well maintained and a wide variety of equipment, friendly staff and easy access to Stevens MRT and Cold Storage next door! Been coming since last November and enjoy the music choices and lighting :)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOX2J5WGR3EAE
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Huimin,5,"I joined Anytime Fitness Stevens in Oct 2024 towards the end of a personal training program elsewhere, and looking for another gym to sustain my fitness journey on my own.  Been with AF Stevens for about 5 months. I chose this as my home gym as it is very near MRT like maybe a few mins walk away and is on my route to office. AF Stevens is pretty well equipped, usually well maintained with 4 squat racks, hack squat machine, hip thrust machine, smith machine, back extension, pec fly machine, leg extension, hip abductor machine, T-bar, seated rows, lat pull down, at least 4 benches and many more, and also a separate room beside for cardio machines like treadmills. The gym is well spaced and not so crowded at least during the time I usually go. What I like most is the gym provides lockers (u use your own padlock but that is good enough) and has shower facilities which some other AF gyms don’t have which is important to me as I don’t live exactly near the gym.

They also provide sanitizer sprays and towels for us to wipe the machines which some other AF gyms don’t have.  It is well ventilated air conditioned with fans rotating and blowing.

I am shifting house in a few months time and the AF gym which is in my new neighbourhood does not have locker and shower facilities…

I think I will miss AF Stevens already…
Keep it up AF Stevens team!

Thanks.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRMzVxQVN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Stevens,szehow ng,1,"I’ve been frequenting AF Stevens branch for over 3 years now. Throughout my time here, I can say that this is a good gym with nice equipment and a great owner.

Unfortunately, a highly unpleasant experience with one of their staff (I suspect I know which one) has led me to the decision to stop frequenting this branch.

The incident involved a fine (of which I received no warning of). When discussing the matter, the staff member, among other things, threatened to block access to my FOB and refused to allow me to talk directly to the boss. The issue does not lie with the fine itself - I am open to paying it. The issue lies in the manner and unprofessionalism in which this particular staff member dealt with the issue. It is poor business sense and no way to treat a loyal customer of 3+ years. My requests of speaking directly with the boss were reasonable and appropriate.

As a result of all this, I’ll be looking to change my membership to a more convenient location near my workplace at the earliest opportunity.

It’s unfortunate that this singular experience with this particular staff member has ruined an otherwise pleasant 3+ years at AF Stevens. I’d recommend the owner to take corrective action against the staff in question, so as to avoid similar incidents happening to other members in the future. It’s particularly disappointing and unfortunate, as I have actually talked to the owner on multiple occasions, and he is a very nice uncle.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYNUxEMzlnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Chris Koh,5,"New equipment and clean.
Awesome place.

1hr free parking at the apartment carpark is a bit short though. Would rather a 1.5hr or a 2hr free parking for gym goers.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMGFhcnF3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Khim Siang Kua,5,Nice and clean gym with all the necessary equipments! Very friendly and helpful staff and gym members! The selection of music is power too! 🤘🏼 Overall a gym with very positive vibes! 💪🏼 Oh! And they sell really delicious and wallet friendly protein powders! Go check it out! 😉 …,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOay1PeGJnEAE
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Dan O,5,"Definitely one of the best gyms I’ve been too! Not only are the staff super nice & friendly, but the committee of gym goers are too. In terms of equipments and space, it is more than enough for an average guy/girl looking to get a workout in",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdGJ6YkJREAE
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Rishi Anand,5,"I’ve been a member for more than 3 years and really enjoy my workouts here. The gym now has a separate cardio section leaving enough space even when it gets busy.
Ian is a fantastic trainer and after trying a few other types of workouts I can vouch for the results one can get training here.
Highly recommend the place to anyone in the area. The proximity to Steven’s mrt is another added advantage.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOdmRhM0JBEAE
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Chili Red Arowana,3,"Small outlet, the cardio room is diff from the weight lifting room… it’s quite dark not enough lighting in the cardio room… hence 3 star, but overall feels ok.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2bEptUUVnEAE
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Marcus Lim,5,"This is a friendly neighborhood gym.
The staff here are close friends with many of the members.
Take Mr Venturi Wong as an example. He is friendly to all gym members and constantly chit chats with all. I have encountered rude and unreasonable staff from other anytime fitness gyms, and I will never go back there.
If you want a friendly gym with a relatively wide range of equipment. This is the place to go to.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1MTdIOGd3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Stevens,Kelvin Tan,5,This is a great af. Super clean and well maintained equipment. From the outside it may look small but it's surprisingly roomy on the inside. I liked the selection of machines as I saw they had a hack squat and incline chest support row machine as well which aren't so common in the other AFs I've been to.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwMVlxcGZ3EAE

Anytime Fitness Stevens,Danial Oliver,5,"Smaller than most gyms, but that's gives it a home-y feel.

Anytime Fitness Stevens,Adam Y,1,"The Anytime Fitness Steven's franchisee isn't a very honest business owner. I was informed that I would be precharged for membership during P2HA which gym use was prohibited. Then after their attempt to say it's a misunderstanding, I proceeded to inform them that I'd be terminating my membership.

I have been trying to get a confirmation on the cancellation after multiple attempts and my membership is still active.

Poor communication, poor business ethics and bad service.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2X052UkF3EAE
