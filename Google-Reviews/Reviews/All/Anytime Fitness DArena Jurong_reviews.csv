Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,5,"Good outlet. Quite empty on a weekday afternoon. Plenty of squat racks and a platform for powerlifting. The variety machine is also great. The functional training area is big with good equipment such as sleds and ski-ergs. For those who love group exercises, they also have classes in the evenings. Staffs are quite friendly. They also provide small towels for your workout. Such a shame I don't stay anywhere near this outlet, else I would frequent here.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURnNGFiN213RRAB

The equipment is modern and comprehensive, catering to all types of workouts — from strength training to cardio and functional exercises. Machines are always in good working condition, and any maintenance is attended to quickly.

What really sets this gym apart is the team. The staff are friendly, professional, and always ready to help. Whether it’s assisting with equipment, answering questions, or just offering a warm greeting, their positive energy makes a big difference.

It’s also a huge plus that the gym is open 24/7 — super convenient for those with busy or irregular schedules.

Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Linus Lee,5,"Anytime Fitness D’Arena is radically exceptional, radically generous, radically authentic.

Where most AF outlets nickel-and-dime you for classes, D’Arena flips the script: daily Yoga Wheel, Hyrox, and more — all free, all real, all transformative. No gimmicks, no gloss, no games. Just substance, sincerity, and strength.

Special mention to Ryan — my Hyrox partner. His energy is not the canned hype of the average trainer, but effusive, grounded encouragement that forges genuine connection. Instead of a sales pitch and empty theory, Ryan delivers presence, partnership, and purpose.

Facilities impress, yes. But it’s the ethos that sets D’Arena leagues above the AF norm. If you want fitness that transcends façade, this is it.

The washrooms are spotless, and the amenities offered, such as towels and chargers, really enhance the overall workout experience. What truly sets this gym apart, though, is the staff. They are extremely kind, always friendly, and genuinely care about the members. Shoutout to Colan, Ryan, and Hazwan!

Recently, the gym organized a trip to Batam, which was packed with fun activities for everyone. It was such a thoughtful gesture, and shows how much they value their community. The members here are like a family, making the gym experience wholesome and enjoyable.

Overall, this is hands down the best gym ever, with absolutely no complaints or bad remarks from me. Highly recommend!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3bVA3MGZ3EAE

Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,l l.,5,"My first AF gym, and still the best AF gym I've been to. It may not be the biggest but it makes up for it with a wide variety of equipment that ensures you'll have a well rounded workout. The space is clean, and the huge amount of natural lighting makes this a very bright and comfortable space to work out in.

The provision of free towels is something that's spoilt me — now I'm always looking for towels in other gyms. 👀

And of course, big shout out to the team here at d'Arena. I've yet to go to an outlet with staff that is this friendly and welcoming. They serve with a smile and really makes you feel like they are happy to help, and that you're not a bother. P.s. Colan: long time no see, but miss talking to you. Always makes me feel like I'm catching up with family when you come by to talk to me 🥰

It takes me an hour to get to this gym from home, and I still make time to go down when I can even though there's a few different AF gyms that are closer to me. Hope that tells you what you need to know about this gym 💪

Oh also, the music here is awesome. 😉🤭",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT201eGFqRlJiM3BUVjFBM1kwazBXblJ1UVVNeGJtYxAB
Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Valerie Ng,5,"This place deserves more recognition, imho!!

Equipment and amenities are like new considering that they have just opened end of 2021. Kudos to the owner and team taking feedback so constructively, especially when we recommended getting smaller weight plates and it was delivered the next week. Additionally, they have gotten a new Eleiko bar in specifically for the competing lifters looking for calibrated bars. Nothing short of amazing from the team from D’Arena, it’s the top gym in the west 👍🏻.
Oh keep a lookout for the complimentary fruits too!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNG9uVXZRRRAB
Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Jameson Tan,5,"The gym offers a welcoming atmosphere, with friendly and approachable staff who make every visit enjoyable. They go the extra mile by offering a free body scan every three months, helping members track their progress and stay motivated. Occasionally, they even give out complimentary parking coupons, adding a nice touch of convenience for their members. For added comfort, they provide free towels for members to use during their workouts. The equipment is always well-maintained, ensuring a safe and effective workout environment. The community is equally supportive, with members being friendly and always willing to share tips and advice, making it a great place to grow and achieve your fitness goals.

Highly recommended!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBbTcyZVN3EAE
Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Stephanie Chow,5,"Extremely spacious and probably one of the most well equipped Anytime Fitness I have been to in Singapore.

They have a technology machine to analyse your full body composition, shoulder flexibility, posture and many more. Really very in-depth!!

And there’s even a large space catered for dedicated lessons such as zumba yoga hiit etc with music blasting from a loud boom box!!

Located just a stone throw away from the train station. Very convenient too. Several facilities and food outlets nearby too.

Perfect place to workout aft work !!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHMC1IUW1RRRAB
Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Val Ng (SeiHao),5,"I’ve been using this gym for almost two years, and it has been a fantastic experience.

Colon and Ryan are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and approachable. The gym has an energizing atmosphere, with great music and a supportive community that fosters a positive vibe.

The class offerings are impressive as well, with a variety of options ranging from strength training to yoga, zumba and many more. Personal training services are also available for those looking for extra guidance.

Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,Su Hui,2,"My initial experience was great. I’ve heard horror stories of members who had issues cancelling their membership with other AF branches and was assured it wouldn’t happen here. I signed up for 18 months and was relatively happy throughout, the people are nice. However, when it came time to cancel my membership, they kept delaying their response and didn’t want to furnish me with the form to confirm the cancellation. I was constantly asked to go down to their gym and asked why I wanted to cancel (when I had already given my reasoning a few times both on text and in person). After much chasing I finally got the cancellation form and was assured that January will be my final billing month.

Today (1st February) my credit card was charged and I am appalled at the service of this gym. I’ve reached out to their team and hope their service recovery will redeem them.

Just to be clear, AF is great if you have no intentions to leave. It’s only problematic when you try to cancel your membership. I have been highly dissatisfied with the cancellation process and communication hence the low rating.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBbnNTVDdBRRAB
