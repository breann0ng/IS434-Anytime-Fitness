Anytime Fitness Katong,Jack,4,Very nice clean and well organized gym floor. There are 2 levels and feel well spaced out. Not that many cardio machines but it's a gym rat heaven. Many machines that cover all your body needs to train. Plenty of toilets and showers as well in level 2. Aircon is cold and plenty of pigeon holes for your bags too. Only gripe is hard to find parking in this area.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tSbVNYVm1UMEp2UTJzMFMwbFBZMVpvVkd4bk1uYxAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Case Woo,5,"Our regular gym has been upgraded with a new look, better lighting and some new equipment. Best fitness group in the world. Shiok.

Happy Halloween!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21aQ2RtUkhXazFYVW5KWmVDMXdNRVpqWjAwM01GRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Dee Dee,2,"Update 26 Oct: seems like this branch can't handle feedback well. My husband and I visited couple weeks ago after their refurbishment and was appalled that many of the cardio machines at level 2 not working I.e. treadmill at least 2-3 not functional/stuck, only 1 elliptical machine not working too. Not sure what the branch is upset about with my honest feedback and wanting to report violation. If you can't properly manage the equipment and fix them, then don't be afraid to receive honest feedback from gym goers. I'd now rather visit Marine Parade, Kembangan or Chai Chee branches.

Alot of machines are not working / spoilt at level 2 :(",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pKNWQxRkRhRXhDWDB4NWJqaEVVekpaZG1WZmNrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Lucien Lim,4,"Spacious, clean, good location, and well-maintained. There is a large function area on the 2nd floor (washrooms are there too). Only caveat is the limited benches available, as well as the small selection of weights. Overall a good branch of AF, great for a regular workout.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMzdlNzBnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Kinescape,5,Well equipped & maintained. Very clean too! Level 2 is the functional area. The AC is very cold 🤣. Overall one of the best AF in Singapore that we visited. …,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNycTU2TkRREAE
Anytime Fitness Katong,Allan Wooding,5,"Decent location with a good range of equipment and a second floor studio for group classes, functional training and stretching. The staff are very hospitable and I could see clearly they care a lot about the gym users 💕. I had a minor issue with the body scanner (not free by the way) and they reached out to resolve it quickly and ask for feedback. I'm so impressed with the service of the manager I had to update my review to 5 stars.
Be aware though that weights are generally not returned so you might need to run around to get the right weights for some machines. Only 2 free weight racks means you might have a wait when it's busy as well.
Otherwise, good kettlebell range, I like the cushioned floor upstairs, and well placed water coolers.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3LWVXdWF3EAE

The trainers are all top-tier professionals who genuinely care about your progress, and it’s clear they’re invested in helping you reach your goals. Honestly, what a solid team. The community vibe is amazing, too—it really feels like you’re part of something, not just another gym member.

The gym itself is always clean, well-maintained, and well-equipped.

Overall, this gym has everything you need and more to crush your fitness goals. Couldn’t ask for a better place to train. Highly recommend!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQcks2bGdnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Katong,Eileen Lau,4,"The gym and equipment are consistently very clean, which I appreciate!

I also like that they have multiple spacious, clean showers. The small area with hair dryers, mirrors, and a sink is a great touch—it really completes the post-workout experience. :)

Anytime Fitness Katong is one of my preferred gym to visit.

The only downside is that the strength area can get pretty cramped during peak hours.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNINU9iWWhRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Titus,4,"Great functional area, very much lacking in strength training area.

One full floor for functional training, spacious and everything is in great condition.

Tiny strength area that is shared with reception and cardio machines. There’s a total of 2 squat/bench racks and 1 smith machine, sufficient dumbbells but gets pretty packed on a regular weekday.

Would come here for functional training, but AF at Marine Parade for strength.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cUptZGd3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Endro Sunarso,4,Nothing great. Run of the mill gym. Update - However the place is spotlessly clean with very friendly staff -  which makes the difference. Been there at least a dozen times in the past month & it is their staff's happy demeanour & client services that impressed me.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHanFydjVRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Yassy Chan,4,"We were members from another branch of Anytime Fitness, but since we recently moved to the East we started coming here.

The gym has a spacious 1-floor, open layout. The staff was very friendly and they even had personal touches such as Friday snacks. Their fitness class schedule also had a good variety.

In terms of equipment, the machines seem well maintained based on our first few visits. We went in the afternoon and while there were a number of people, it was not too crowded.

We are night owls and so a 24-hour gym that's located with easy access (it's like it's own shop vs inside a mall) definitely helps.

Looking forward to working out here more.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWXzVlRXVnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Sanae Inada,5,"I like this gym! It’s super clean, organized, and the staff are incredibly friendly. The second-floor workout space is a great addition and I find very useful.

Anytime Fitness Katong,J Kek,5,"Very nice gym with a huge functional area and a good selection of equipment. My favourite gym in the area.

Update (8 Sep 24): good to see that the gym is refreshing the layout and adding a deadlift platform. A suggestion to make the gym even better is to consider have another 1-2 squat racks and a glute drive machine",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURicXJ6ZmlBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,nusha dakshyni,5,"It’s at a great location, with good equipments. The free weights and ab mats are on the second floor, which is convenient to end workouts there! As compared to sharing space with the rest of the gym. It might get a little crowded during peak hours. Toilets are clean!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxazYtVk9nEAE
Anytime Fitness Katong,Dan J,3,"Well stocked gym with decent space and location. Customer service is average when you speak to them but some of my messages were left unreplied to.

They also said I would be able to be able to use other gyms in the city but for some reason they restricted my account and only rectified once I had asked for a cancellation.

Late payment fees are absurdly priced and frustrating to deal with - I had a card stolen shortly before the scheduled payment and there was no chance to change payment detail in time and no flex on the late payment fee.

Overall, the gym is good but the experiences above have driven me out.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNkamR2Vk93EAE
Anytime Fitness Katong,Ben Koh,5,"AF Tanjong Katong is well equipped and well maintained, with a very spacious functional training area and more than adequate washrooms on the second floor. My only misgiving is that the free weight area is slightly smaller compared to the larger gyms, with only 2 squat racks and one smith machine. That being said, the management has used the space rather adequately and as a seasoned gym goer I can safely say you can get in a pretty good work out for any muscle group of your choice, even if it’s crowded, with a little patience. Trainers and members are friendly too. Definitely worth a visit.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwbmU3LW1RRRAB
Anytime Fitness Katong,Ace S,5,"Nice, quiet gym that is in a relatively convenient location.

Would also strongly recommend the trainer Faz in particular as she is quite patient and dedicated in getting her trainees to their fitness goals.

Have been on my fitness journey with her and she has motivated me to come for training with her enthusiastic and friendly attitude. But be warned, even though she’s really nice, her training can be quite tough, so you’re guaranteed to see results.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcnFTMWZBEAE
Anytime Fitness Katong,Jessie Naidu,5,"Did an indoor cycling class here, was super challenging but also fun!

Anytime Fitness Katong,HuiChun Ni,5,"Faz is a very nice trainer who is very patient when training me, especially since I am still recovering from an injury.

Anytime Fitness Katong,Nadiah P,5,"It is a newly build double-story gym with a spacious area so you won't feel someone is in your personal space during your workout. They provide a sufficient number of conventional cardio machines and weight-lifting area. Staffs are friendly and ready to answer your questions as needed. In addition to the great interior and the people, I would say the location itself. It is near a bus stop, healthy/delicious food nearby and walking distance to the malls. There may be other gyms around the block, but who doesn't know Anytime Fitness!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bS0zSG9RRRAB

Anytime Fitness Katong,Jonathan Ball,5,"Clean, friendly staff, and top notch customer service!

Attended this gym during my visit to Singapore. I initially inquired about purchasing a new tag to enter the gym, but was informed there was no need to spend the extra money as I was only there for a couple of weeks. I forgot to ask for the staff member's name, but she had sent an email to the entire team informing them who I was.
The next time I visited the gym, the staff already knew I was a visitor from Australia, and entrance to the gym was as if I was a local, the only difference being I had to ring the doorbell.

Thank you for your hospitality!

Another mention to all the attendees for always keeping the gym clean. Everyone I saw there was diligent in returning weights to their proper places and wiping down equipment after use, something I'm not used to seeing in a large chain gym.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNXM3Zhb0xREAE

1. Dumbbells go up to 45kg, great knurling on handle, always clean and some weights ( 15 kg, etc ) have 2 pairs which is nice during peak hours.

2. Top tier equipment like Life Fitness and Hammer Strength. Some rare ones too like the Stairmaster and the Plate Loaded Iso Row ( my personal favorite )

3. Clean toilets and showers. There's even hair dryers, same as the AF I went to in Japan a few years back which is nice. Not sure if this is standard across all AF in Singapore but it's always nice to see some personalization.

Anytime Fitness Katong,Christopher Bobin,5,"Anytime Fitness Tanjong Katong is located in an area known for Peranakan culture, so the vibe of this neighborhood is different from that which you would get in the typical mall experience in Singapore. As such, this Anytime Fitness offers the chance for an interesting change of scenery as well as a first rate facility for exercise.  When I first walked in for a peek, they had just opened and one of the friendly and courteous staff was happy to show me the facility, which is two floors: On the ground level is most of the weights, machines and aerobic equipment while the second floor is for group classes, etc.  And they have showers!, something lacking in a lot of AF outlets: This is good if you are working out during the day and returning to office.  The scale and scope of equipment is sufficient for any serious weight training.  Afterward, explore the neighborhood as there is an excellent mix of old and new restaurants and food options for that all-important post-workout meal...

Elsa set up the appointment & it was seamless.

I received another message from her, to remind me of my appointment the following morning which was great.

I was 20 minutes late for my appointment & informed Elsa, which she referred me to another lady, Filzah, probably because she has somewhere else to be too. Fair enough, since i was late...

Upon arrival, Filzah received me as though i was liaising with her the whole time, which proves that their backend communication was on point & flawless.

Filzah was detailed, patient & answered all my questions without any hiccup. The sign up process was super smooth & swift.
