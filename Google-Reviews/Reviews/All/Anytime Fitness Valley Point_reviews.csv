Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Yasmin Khouri,1,"Worst audio choice known to mankind. Used to come here a lot (they used to play pop/kpop playlists which was wonderful).

Nowadays they spam the channels with kiss 92 and 987 FM which is literally more ads than music. Will definitely go to other AF places in town instead. I don't pay a monthly subscription to have Mitsubishi Electronics ads shoved down my throat 5 times a minute at max volume.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwUFVtVmtObVE1UkVkM1dHeG5Ua1o2ZUY4eFpIYxAB
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Annabelle Yeoh,5,My early morning go-to spot - it’s clean and well-equipped. Also a special mention to the staff here - I lost my earring one morning running on the treadmill and they made a significant effort in helping me recover it (it was under the machine)! Really appreciate the kind of service and attentiveness that’s becoming rare these days!,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25RMlFWRlVVRVZCU1dKamNUQTJka3hIVFhneFdsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Craig Pak,5,Anytime Fitness ValleyPoint has to be the nicest outlet I’ve ever been too! The newly renovated branch has so many machines that I can try. What I love especially is the huge shower toilets that they have!,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIN0tIX3h3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Agnes Lim,5,"I shifted out of this neighbourhood and this was my home gym when I first joined Anytime Fitness. Currently using an Anytime Fitness outlet in the east but I still enjoy using this outlet because of the people in the gym and the environment. I still try to visit this outlet at least once or twice a month. It is too much cleaner and the layout is spacious. They still offer sanitiser spray with cloth and sanitising wipes for us to clean equipment. A great effort to keep the equipment clean and fresh. I love the big studio area and I think they still offer complimentary classes to members.

Staff are definitely much friendlier than any other outlet that I visited. A big smile and greeting from the team whenever I enter the gym. Not the newest equipment compared to the new outlets but it still work well. Most importantly, less member using their mobile while using the equipment.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNEs2WV9nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Anotation,3,Yall need to make all ur toilets unisex. It really doesnt make sense on offpeak weekday and men cannot use toilets just cos someone's showering and the ladies toilets are empty.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tSemVFNXViMG81U2poWlN6TlRVV3R6TjFOUVUyYxAB
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,M W,4,"Th gym is clean, well maintained and spacious. Some of the equipment are a little dated but overall it has everything you need for a good workout. Just don't compare it with the newer gyms. Showers with toilets are a plus.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvcWNmUkxnEAE
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Sylvester,1,"💥Read this first before heading to this gym.

Long story short, if Rocky Balboa headed into this gym he will feel right at home, all of the equipments here are so old they look like they were transported here from the 1979 Rocky II movie set. (Rocky II because Rocky 1 would probably be too expensive for Anytime fitness to afford.)

I've been to many AF outlets across Singapore and this is the worst. If any gym needed to swap in new equipments, this Anytime fitness outlet at Valley point would be where all the old gym equipments are stored.

They should set up a treasure hunt event here, if you can find any gym equipment that isn't rusty, you'll get one month's free membership.
(Refer to photos)

Rating 1🌟star : A clean storeroom for old gym equipment at best.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwekpXeTF3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,JP,1,"Worst gym experience ever.

Gym itself
- Worn-out equipment
- Smelly bathroom

Contract
- When your contract expires, you are not notified and they will keep charging you the same monthly amount.
- When you talk to them about it, they will tell you that you need to explicitly tell them you want to quit.
- When you tell them you want to quit, they will tell you that there is a 30-day notice period.
- I felt getting tricked all the time because none of this was explained to me verbally when I signed up, but apparently it's all in the terms and conditions. I recommend using a lawyer when signing up for membership here.

Other Anytime Fitness
- I used AF Pasir Panjang before and it was excellent. Facilites were well maintained and there was nothing ridiculous about their cancellation or other policies. Staff there help you to get the most out of your membership unlike people here who do not explain anything and only tell you to read the contract.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3MjVPcXJ3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Tiong Chester,5,"Wow, Anytime Fitness at Valley Point has totally leveled up! The renovation has given the place a fresh, clean vibe with tons of shiny new equipments. The gym is huge, and everything is spaced out perfectly, so it never feels cramped. The staff are super welcoming—big shoutout to James and the two lovely ladies who always make my day with their help and smiles.

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Chili Red Arowana,5,"The toilet is the best in all the outlets I’ve tried, large toilets with shower cubicle together. Gym is large but the vibe here too Atas nose held high people.. (not friendly environment) if you can tolerate these ppl you will have enjoyable time in this big gym. Another downside is that the location is not near MRT, so you will have to walk 15-20mins to the nearest.. no wonder not many people come here",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dm8tb1NREAE
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Thinesh Supra,5,"My go-to gym, extremely friendly staff since day 1, they have always been very pro active in assisting me with any help that I need.

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,WanderWithWit,4,This is indeed a very nice workout space located near Great World City and Orchard.

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Seamus Tardif,1,"Extremely disappointed with the exit process for this particular gym. I went to pause my membership which they then wanted to charge me a monthly fee for. Why should I pay you to not use your service? Then I wanted to cancel my membership, which again they charge an extra month for, once again, I can’t use the service at this time. Basically, I think it’s completely unethical that you charge people to leave your service and that you charge people to pause their membership. You’re clearly focused on getting money out of people rather than actually providing a service. Additionally, I went to return my lanyard that I paid $85 for, but you don’t refund people for it. I mean, what the hell am I going to do with a lanyard for a gym I won’t be going to?

I’ll safely say that I will never use any of your outlets again. You’ve completely lost my trust as a business, and I would actively encourage people to use a different provider.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCLVo2ek9BEAE
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Farhan Samad,5,"I like this gym as it's has good space, Furthermore i signed up for personal trainer and got Fai. He has now trained me for a full solid month twice a week and my strength is getting better. I am 1.84cm tall and skinny (but not anymore) now i have gained a good amount of muscle mass as days goes by from his guidance and training. I really recommend for those who wants a good workout routine to sign up with him.

The staff over there are also friendly and nice. Thank you to the AF Team!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURteDZPN0J3EAE
Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Zuner Terence,5,"I've been thru a lot of AF brunch, from East West North to Central and AF Valley point has been my most favourite gym ever. Their staff are helpful and super friendly which make you feel this gym like your second home =) !

They have good setting and comprehensive equipments for your work out. During this Covid19 outbreak, I can see their staff putting so much effort to keep the gym clean hygiene during the day and night.

Some of my friends complain the equipments are rusty, but come on, this is not a brand new gym like others. I wear gloves during my gym session and I don't think this is a big problem.

It's not overwhelming like other branch which located near to the MRT. This AF definitely a good place for you to work out if u are staying around the community or if you could drive.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURhMU9pMlFBEAE

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Dave Singh,1,"Well I understand that but that doesn’t benefit me in any which way right. Signage has been placed but denying someone membership on the basis of not re racking weights is terrible, like that unheard of you could have but up a fine or penalty of some sort in it but you guys didn’t. No one in the management ever came up once to speak about this matter to me and it’s your gym and you can run it the way you wanna it but I didn’t like that and I am going to voice it .",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1NmM2QXNnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Antoine R,4,"Small gym but quite similar to others Anytime Fitness in the country.
All the equipment you need is there but unfortunately at peak hours you have to wait for squats racks (only 2) and there’s no bench press so you have to use a rack. There’s also not many benches. I could be greatly improved with one more bench and rack.
Most of the equipment is precor and some life fitness.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNLaUxXTXBBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Valley Point,Jagdeep Sekhon,5,"Hi! I am Jagdeep Sekhon, 2 months ago I started exercising with Mr. Thinesh as my personal Trainer.
Not having exercised for a very long time I was worried but when I met and got to know Thinesh I knew he was my perfect trainer.
He is very professional yet kind, patient, and has a good understanding. His encouragement gave me the self-confidence I needed to complete this exercise session. He created motivating Workouts that allowed me to improve my body strength, flexibility, and balance.
My Target initially was to lose weight and control my blood sugar level.
After 2 months I am pleased with my progress and feel confident that with his continued training and encouragement, I would continue getting good results and achieve my goal.
Looking forward to continuing new workout sessions with him in the future.
Thanks so much, Thinesh!!!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCakx1bE9REAE
