Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Matti Leppänen,5,"*adjusting my review to 5 stars after the staff kindly alerted me to the existence of the main gym space on B1 🤦🏼‍♂️

Very nice Anytime Fitness outlet! Clean space with brand new equipment. Two areas on two different floors.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT205MFZrazBTMmRMU1dOSVZHUXdlVlIxUjI1alZsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Howard Bennett,5,"I’ve been using the facilities at Anytime Fitness Kembangan since late March and have had a consistently positive experience.

The gym is well-equipped across both levels, and I’ve particularly appreciated the welcoming and professional attitude of the manager, Imran. He’s consistently courteous, actively engages with members, and shows genuine concern for safety standards — something I’ve witnessed first-hand, especially when addressing improper footwear (like flip-flops) or unsafe equipment use.

Yes, like in many gyms, there are moments when members occupy machines while scrolling on their phones — a personal pet peeve of mine — but that’s more about user etiquette than staff performance.

In my experience, there’s been no sign of discriminatory behavior. Quite the opposite — the environment has been inclusive, respectful, and well-managed.

Every experience may differ, but I believe in giving credit where it’s due.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21KcFkxZFhUblV3ZGpkd1psQlBNbTVDUzNCWlJuYxAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,fiona yun,1,"Very disappointed with the service attitude at this gym. The staff often speak in a rude and dismissive tone, showing little regard for respectful communication.

What’s more troubling is that, based on my own observations, there appears to be unequal treatment of customers depending on their race. Some people seem to receive noticeably more friendly and attentive service, while others are treated coldly or impatiently.

This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable in a professional setting. As paying customers, we all deserve to be treated with fairness and respect.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tSZlZUQlJjVVZKUlVNNVZEWTVUSGxhVmxOTVduYxAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Lauren Elizabeth,3,"Kembangan AF is not great compared to a lot of other AFs 😖 it’s quite small and the machines are old, and the cardio level (disconnected from the machine level) always has a lot of mosquitoes for some reason. The stairmaster is suuuuper old …",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2poclEzSjVORjlvWlRCQlEzZHdibXAyUm1rMmEzYxAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,公孙离,1,"There is a problem with management. Today, a few muscular men said they were managers, but they couldn't provide any information and kicked me out",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT213MlJYTndkbTE1UzBnMlExaG1WbEJFYjI1WU9GRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,hailey min,1,"Warning 🚨

If you want to cancel your membership, do not accept their “freeze” offer — you must give at least one month’s notice in advance. If you try to cancel just 3 days before your billing date, they will absolutely not allow it. Instead, they’ll proceed with the scheduled auto-payment and take your money anyway.

Even if you’re completely unable to use the facility, you’ll still be charged. That’s how my $115 ended up thrown away.

They never informed me about the one-month cancellation notice beforehand. Their excuse? That it was explained when I signed up — almost two years ago. As if any regular member would clearly remember those details after that much time.

Even when I requested a cancellation, they offered me a freeze instead — yet failed to mention anything about the one-month notice, which is a crucial policy. They claim it wasn’t intentional, but honestly, it felt very deliberate to me. They justify it by calling it their ‘protocol’ — sounds more like a protocol for misleading customers to me.

Two years of positive experience with Anytime Fitness? All wiped out — and what remains is this bitter ending.

I truly hope you improve this “protocol” and grow into a company that customers can genuinely trust.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJdmJXR1NBEAE
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Daniel Liu,1,Staff is rude and discriminates against foreign nationals. Would recommend finding alternative gyms in the area as the price is not worth the lousy attitude you have to put up with,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xCbWIwdFlSbWMwZVdjM1dEaHZaVlZxVUZsdFdFRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Nicolle Yong,1,"The customer service at this gym is disappointing, to say the least. Slow and unresponsive during staffing hours. I asked if I could come down for the one day free trial in the afternoon, which they acknowledged, but the front desk was empty and they did not answer my calls or text messages when I arrived. I waited for 15-20mins but to no avail. They have been unresponsive since. (I called and messaged during staffing hours, 12-9PM)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNnNEl5NkxnEAE
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,J Kek,3,"Cosy gym across 2 levels with a decent range of equipment. It is inconvenient to traverse the 2 levels to access the equipment so it will be great if the gym can consider moving some strength training equipment from the 1st floor to B1, such as the back hypertension bench, and adding another squat rack since there is only one rack now. I believe there is space to accommodate them by rearranging the layout. Will also be great to have posters to remind members of gym etiquette - I have seen people working out in non-gym attire (eg pyjamas pant and slippers), just chilling around and using phones in non-gym attire, and talking very loudly among their group of friends",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIZzlqRW1nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Stephen Chua,1,"Update:
Only after leaving this review, I received a follow-up call from the owner. Unfortunately, the tone of the call was confrontational, with accusation that my review was ‘unfair.’

Original review:
Scheduled callback waited for many days and no reply. Call and no pick up. Receptionist is sleeping on their job, best to check on them regularly.

Update:
Emphasis on “scheduled callback” not just saturday..",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmMm95VVBREAE

Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Muhammad Zakaria,1,Gym is too small even if there are two floors.

Anytime Fitness Kembangan,Mee K,1,Unsatisfactory customer service. Payment failed due to technical issues. Called very same day in an hour to make payment but ended up being charged late fee and that too on a public holiday ☹️. The lady never tried to help by waving off the charge when decided to cancel.
