Anytime Fitness Upper Changi,Clement Santhanasamy,5,"Great place to have a good fitness. Gym with good and new and basic equipment which is necessary to workout, if you plan to get into boxing, they do provide personal sessions for it and our friend Ahmeed is such a wonderful person to work with. I’ve personally have sessions with him and I loved his workout routine. Not forgetting our brother Russ as well who is a bodybuilder himself who can also help to get yourself into either bodybuilding or into fitness as well. Do check out if you’re up to guys! I’m really enjoying working out with them. God bless them for guiding me all this while and looking forward for more time together with them.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNELTctc1J3EAE

Anytime Fitness Upper Changi,Spartan Dan,4,"I came in a time when the gym is quite empty. Everything is relatively new. Very clean and good atmosphere.
One squat rack with in built deadlift platform.
Another squat rack..
A few machines with loaded plates as well. And bodyweight area for functional exercises.
Decent and good enough for a quick workout.
This gym only can get a 4 star as I believe the toilet is quite a distance to walk if I need to urgently rush, jialat.
And parking lot is quite pricey so for bikers can park at the private estate area but at your own risk lor.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUOUstck5BEAE
