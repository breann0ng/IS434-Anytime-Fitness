Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Tang Lynne-Xuan,2,"gym was small and most of the basic equipment needed. not too bad. but there is no toilet, changing room or even water cooler inside the gym. you need a key access to enter the toilet outside the gym.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOMkN1TGVLMXRydENREAE
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Daryl Venpin,5,"Compact gym with all necessary fitness equipements that one needs to get pumped!
I kinda love it, as I was alone in the gym.
Take note that there is no toilet there, but there is a vending machine, in case you forgot your protein.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5a1lLaVBREAE
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,SP Ang,1,"This was a highly inappropriate case handling by the manager, causing mental distress to a student who was unable to pay the subscription fees due to a sudden injury and immediate subscription cancellation. Instead of offering support, the manager threatened using ‘legal’action and even contacted the child directly to demand payment despite the parent telling him to refrain from calling the child.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tjeWRXMXpVblJMVURSWk9DMXhjV1JwVTI5elMwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Colin Dailey,2,Very small gym. Not crowded. Clean. Rather well equipped for the size. Absolutely no changing room and no toilet. I found one toilet but it’s locked and nobody knows how to access it.  Quite frustrating to show up for a workout and then not being able to work out because no place to put on my gym clothes.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3azdMLTVBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Daniel DPC,1,Gym felt stuffy upon entering. There’re no toilets or water coolers. Only come if you’re desperate.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pjeGIwMVdObFpxZUY5VlEyUnJhR1JOTjNGdVVIYxAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Hao Jun Chua,2,Small gym but functional. Very little benches though. Downside is that the aircon was off and whole gym so stuffy. Would have been an average gym if not for the air conditioning.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwMzVtTWN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Tony Stark,1,"Extremely poor gym maintenance. Air conditioner has been down for the past 3 weeks, coming to 1 month. Nothing has been done so far. I suppose that the gym management is definitely incompetent.
Apart from the air conditioner, the equipments are rusty, poorly maintained.
do avoid this gym at all cost. very poor management.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaai12VVhnEAE
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Nino Raymond “Nin” Cañizares,4,"The gym is clean, and a private one so if you want some privacy while working out, you might want to train here. Not too spacious and not too small, just the right size. Staff is also accommodating and friendly. Overall, it's good.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNWdU5EWDhBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Kelvin Lee,5,"Gym is well-equipped for it's size, and has everything you need for a great workout. Haven't tried all the lessons yet, but boxing lessons by Jeremy are really fun. Very stress-relieving, and you learn a good skill on the way. Jeremy is a great coach that teaches well. You have so much fun you don't even realise how much you've worked out!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHOFB6OGx3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Vincent (The Cow),3,"Small gym, that is a far cry from its glory days.
Some of the equipment show signs of wear and tear, and little to no maintenance.
At peak times, the place can get crowded and you'll end up taking an hour instead of a 15 minute workout session, with most time spent queueing for equipment time.

No attached showers when i last checked. Not sure if its outside with the toilets.

Overall, i'd avoid unless no choice.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1dGQ3Uy13RRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Nisha,1,"poor upkeep of gym and equipments, cable machine ropes are torn. lack of hygiene. small and no bathroom available. gets very crowded most days, feedback seems to fall on deaf ears… positive reviews on here are mostly off topic, likely to increase ratings of this branch since it’s the worst rated among all",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlejhEUzFnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Amanda Lim,4,"Quite a small space, dumbbell area only has space for 1 bench so you need to wait during peak hours. No toilet/changing room so might need to find inside the CC.

Lots of bands/skipping ropes/belts/other accessories available. 👍🏻",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUMnNpcUNBEAE
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,T B,1,"Updated Review 6 Nov 2022: No changes has been made to the tricep rope( badly torn), leg press machine ( rusty ), gym mats(badly torn)
I guess all the feedback has not been taken seriously. They have 3 trainers but none choose to rectify the issues. Still rated the WORST ANYTIME FITNESS GYM IN SINGAPORE!!!!!!

This is the WORST RATED Anytime Fitness in Singapore. Made a report regarding the leg press machine because it was rusty and old. They just painted over it. There is only one tricep rope which has been used since the gym opened 2 years ago. The rope is torn. Informed them to change it but so far nothing. This gym is so stingy with the money. They don't want to take all the feedback and improve the gym. They just want MONEY from their members. Please do not sign up here. There are better gyms at Greenwich and Gardens area. This gym needs a massive overhaul in their management team. The Outlet Manager Iskandar needs to be Fired. But oh well this gym doesn't do anything from the feedbacks. They will just act blur. Goodbye. Moving on to better anytime fitness gyms.. Remember AVOID THIS GYM AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMyd011Ti1BRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,joshua dave,1,"Updated 14 Nov: Sudden spike in positive comments for the gym after I posted my negative review about them. The review page was not even active for sometime. This truly shows how Personal Trainer GINA is such a sore loser. she is unable to accept the negative feedback and should work on improving herself. She has no passion for the fitness industry. People like her spoil the image of PT around Singapore. Such a disgrace.

This is definitely one of the most poorly run gym around the serangoon, hougang area. Equipment's are rusty. Gym is always in a mess and dirty. Was there during afternoon a couple of times and saw this girl wearing the coach t shirt. She was training her client so badly. Kept talking to the client more than training them. I wonder if she is even qualified by the fitness industry.  Total waste of money. Makes me feel this is one way how they trap and drag the customers in signing for the PT packages. Please beware of this gym!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHaGZhLXJ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Gladys Wee,5,"I have been training with PT Gina for the past 25 sessions. I have lost 4kg of fat as my sessions were irregular. Imagine if it was regular 🤔 nonetheless, the staff have always made me feel comfortable and I would recommend the gym to anyone in the area ☺️",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHMzhXeHpnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,Moi Ish Geek,5,"Friendly trainers who assisted me when I had trouble with the machine and gave me some training tips. Enjoyed the boxing, Muay Thai and Circuit classes on the weekend before the restrictions kicked in! Cosy gym with enough equipments, cannot expect much cos it’s small but good enough for ppl like me who stay so ulu. Thanks Jeremy for the Muay Thai tips too!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcjkyZHZnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hwi Yoh CC,MD,1,"Severely incompetent manager who cannot accept constructive feedback, but instead, argues. Extremely shady sale practices and does not know how to run a business (also, bear in mind it’s only a franchise LOL). Pretty sure there are many people who can attest to this. Also manager needs to learn that clients have the right to leave reviews and feedback.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlbzRuQ1JBEAE
