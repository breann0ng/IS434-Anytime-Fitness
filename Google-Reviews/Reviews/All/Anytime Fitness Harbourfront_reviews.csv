Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,Lim,5,"Spacious gym, machines are just lined up one after another in rows and gives those american gym vibes. High ceiling. Having standard plates with handles instead of bumper plates for the bench & squat racks is a nice touch. Db area has 4 benches. Overall well maintained.

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,david churchill,2,"I was a bit disappointed with the recent refreshment at Anytime Fitness HarbourFront because of the lighting in the gym.
The gym feels quite dark, and the yellow lights made me feel a little lazy and sleepy. The lighting is not only yellow but also quite limited. I think it would be nicer to use more white lights instead.

The reason is simple : yellow light increases the parasympathetic tone, which promotes calmness and sleepiness, whereas white light increases the sympathetic tone, which promotes alertness, energy, and freshness. Most people come to the gym to feel active and motivated so that they can work out effectively.

On the bright side, the gym equipment is excellent, and I enjoy using it.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tOdlpuUjVNbWRGTVRkRFJuTkNhelF3Y0RoWVQyYxAB

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,Castro Arun,5,"18+ Months In - Still Getting Better!
I've been training here for over 18 months, and my experience keeps improving. Having tried at least 15 gyms across Singapore, this is the one where I genuinely feel at home.
The staff continue to be exceptional – always friendly, accommodating, and welcoming. My morning sessions here before work have become non-negotiable for managing stress and starting the day right with that positive energy boost.
Last month's renovation was a game-changer. The layout is now far more functional, with power lifting racks separated into their own zone, plus a few quality machines added to the floor. The new setup reduces congestion and makes every workout more efficient.
Equipment maintenance here is excellent – everything stays functional and well-maintained. Combined with the recent upgrades, this gym truly delivers on all fronts.
If you want a reliable gym with great staff, well-maintained equipment, and smart design, look no further. Highly recommend!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvamNDeEpnEAE

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,Nancy Yeo,2,"DON'T USE HARBOUR FRONT AF

I was at Harbour Front AF from 12.40 - 2.30 pm, 19 July.  Throughout the 2 hours, this group of 3 young gymers (1 female, 2 male) were slamming the weights violently.  It was so noisy, and the slamming each time the trio threw the heavy weights down, was really disconcerting.  Many other gymers looked on with disapproval.  The lady gym staff walked around, did nothing.  I have not heard such a highly noisy gym at any AF outlets.  The trio talked very loudly too - so inconsiderate.

This is so frustrating - their heavy slamming and loud chatter disturbed an otherwise positively energy-charged gym environment.

If this continues, everyone should not use Harbour Front gym.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s5bmRFaG1SRUpSVXpGUVh6ZENjMUp0WTNsbmFWRRAB

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,Jodie Jeffernson,2,"I am deeply concerned by the unprofessional conduct observed at AF Harbourfront. It has come to my attention that an employee, Niegel, has responded to a negative review by attempting to undermine the concerns raised. Allowing staff to leave retaliatory responses simply to discredit a customer's experience is not only inappropriate but also completely unprofessional. This behavior reflects poorly on the establishment and raises serious questions about the company’s commitment to handling customer feedback with respect and integrity.

However, the gym is clean and spacious, the machines are old and somewhat well maintained. Leg curl machine got to go..... horrible machine for hamstring curls due to the fixed padding on knees/thigh.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRMGVlU1dBEAE

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,Praneel,1,"Absolutely horrible gym 😭. Hands down the worst Anytime Fitness location I’ve been to. If this is the closest one to you, PLEASE consider going elsewhere.
1. Toilets: The restrooms are located outside the gym, which is highly inconvenient. You’ll need to bring your key fob to tap in and out every time.
2. Equipment: The machines are really old, particularly the shoulder press, chest press, and chest fly machines. The chest fly machine is completely broken and unusable.
3. No Smith Machine: There’s no smith machine for incline press, though there is a bench press rack, so at least that’s something.
4. Showers: The only redeeming factor is the showers, which are actually decent. There are about four stalls if I recall correctly.

Overall, this gym is disappointing and feels neglected. Definitely not up to the standard you’d expect from Anytime Fitness.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfOU1LODlBRRAB

Previous feedback:
Stop playing depressing songs. It's not why we're at the gym. Don't play tikTok songs either. We have our own headsets too if you can't curate, it's better if your speakers were silent.

Farah is always so warm and welcoming. She’s not only friendly but also offers great advice and motivation, making each workout feel more personal. Iman’s energy is infectious – he’s always upbeat and supportive, pushing me to give my best. Garry is incredibly knowledgeable and always ready to lend a hand with form or offer tips to improve my workout. Niegel’s friendly demeanor and attention to detail make every session feel like a step toward my fitness goals.

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,In2rovert Life,5,"One of my favourite and possibly the most spacious gyms in Singapore.

They have almost everything except their own toilet (you have to use the mall's public one just at the back entrance of the gym)

But.. I think a few people have mentioned this, I mean I'm happy when people workout and are enthusiastic, however... there are certain groups of power lifters there who hog not only the rack squats, but the areas and machines around them.

Quite a few times I've had to ask them if they were using machines nearby, as they were sitting on them to only rest between sets (maybe a bench near the lifting racks would be useful?) and they proceeded back to their power lifting.

Hopefully too, they add more pull-up bar options for calistehnics or something in the corner where the boxes for jumping on are (a small waste of great space)

Overall great staff and great gym with tons of equipment.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqMUlYaUl3EAE

Good vibes - The gym staff especially Dein and Razik are approachable and proactive, always ready to say Hi and give workout tips. The members are also friendly and considerate.

Spacious & well equipped - good layout and use of space between the wide range of machines. Better than most AF gyms even at peak hour due to the larger space and thoughtful placement of equipment.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNiM04tMEtBEAE

Anytime Fitness Harbourfront,Kenny Seong,2,"First time to this club and 2 main feedbacks.

1. Equipment
while I understand that this club was formerly from POMO and the equipment were reused, but it has been a few years and the dumbbells and weight plates on the stack cable machines were rusty yet not replaced.

2. The powerlifters
Firstly, the powerlifters in this club were talking so loud, louder than the club's music. All the laughter, loud talking and weird noises they made affected me on my concentration during my set as I could even hear what they were saying despite me playing max volume on my earpiece. Members working out at the same time, like myself, do not need to know their content, they should be considerate and lower their noise, as this is a public gym and not their private gym. Additionally, staff on duty did not once came out to inform them to lower down their noise.

Secondly, they placed their stuff around, not using towel on benches, put their foot on bench while doing bench press, tripods and used weight plates were everywhere.

Thirdly, they slammed weights no matter what equipment they used, from deadlift, to dumbbells, to cable machine.

Club owner and staff should reinforce the gym etiquette at all times.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0bUlxMzVRRRAB

5 stars! Leaving here for me to remember

Free weights: Very excellent range. Looks very catered to the free weights section, which is my preference. SSB, Swiss bar, axle bar, 3 hansu power powerlifting bars and 1 Ohio power bar (like just how rare is this???)

Equipment : They have a hack squat, which is pretty rare. Quite a few basic machines, definitely more than enough for most people

A week ago I reviewed that I had a small issue with the shower rooms not having racks for personal toiletries. I wasn't even complaining. A week later, I was shocked to see that they had placed toiletries rack in the cubicles. I almost never edit reviews but this deserved praise.

As for the facilities, love the spacious environment. Machines are slightly old due to wear and tear. Surprising no sanitiser spray for us to clean up the machines. It’s probably due to the stage of loosening restrictions.
