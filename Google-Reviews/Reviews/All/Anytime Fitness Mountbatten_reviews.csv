Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Spartan Dan,5,"A nice and pleasant gym.

Equipments well maintained and not so crowded in the morning.

Definitely have a very dedicated PT to guide clients during training.
I was observing how Ross conducts his training to his clients.

Very professional. Goes slow and gives his client time to learn and adapt to the exercises safely. Hope more people comes here to benefit from his training. Keep it up.💪💪

Thanks for the pleasant experience Mountbatten",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZc2F2enJRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Elfarina Roszaini,5,"It’s been about a month since I joined Anytime Fitness Mountbatten, and it’s been such a refreshing way to get back into movement. The gym is clean, bright, and has everything I need without feeling overwhelming.

Big thanks to Kim at the front desk for always being warm and helpful, and to trainers Ross and Andi, who are super supportive and never pushy. I also love that the 24/7 access gives me the flexibility I need, especially on tougher days.

Glad I took the leap!! It has been a really grounding return to my fitness journey.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25KV01GaDNkVmcwV0hRNVowSnBhMjFHTVdNMlRuYxAB

Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Alexander Aaltonen,5,"Probably my new favorite AF gym! Even though this isn't my home gym, I've been coming here quite a bit ever since they opened.

Equipment is brand new and the facilities nice and tidy. They've got pretty much all the essentials and even four racks and two platforms -- making this ideal for leg days 🦿🦿

Usually come here late in the evening and weekends, so far it hasn't been that crowded. 👍",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1N291Z2VnEAE

Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Achmad Firdaus,5,"It’s been close to a month since I took up the July promotional offer for membership at AF Mountbatten, and it has been a great re-introduction to being active and gymming again after a long break. The membership also allows 24/7 access to all AF gyms, locally and worldwide, and this has been great for flexibility and convenience.

Over at Mountbatten, the gym has a bright and welcoming atmosphere, with clean, well-maintained facilities and equipment that make workouts a lot more pleasant.

Special mention to Kim at the front desk for her warm professionalism, and to trainers Ross and Andi, who are knowledgeable, approachable, and always ready with practical advice on form and technique that makes workouts safer and more effective.

For anyone looking to kickstart or restart their fitness journey, AF Mountbatten is a fantastic choice.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21sUGQxbEZRamRMV1doeFp6ZENaR05pWmpaNWFHYxAB
Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Daniel Ng,5,"Went on a Friday night and around 8pm and the crowd was pretty quiet! It's a cosy space with equipment well laid out and the lighting is top notch, very bright. Not a plethora of machines, but enough to get a decent workout in. Unique thing about this AF are the Hammer Strength machines that most AFs don't have, personal favourite is the iso low row!

Slightly strange that the locker area is completely open so anyone at the power racks can see you there. Overall, super clean and well maintained equipment, a nice cosy gym.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5dzgtVjZnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Kim Ricafort,5,"great new gym around the vicinity!

Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Jonathan Leong,1,"Recommended a friend to try out Mountbatten AF, but when she inquired about a trial via text, she was simply told to sign up for a membership instead. No invitation to experience the gym first, just a dismissive response. Disappointing customer service—doesn’t reflect a welcoming fitness community. 1/10.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRaGFEd1d3EAE

Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Vanna Teng,1,"i have never experienced such a response from any AF outlets when requesting for a free trial until today. was actually thinking of visiting this outlet after reading the positive reviews here but... 🤔

full disclaimer: i have been trying various AFs because the outlet that i have signed with have been delaying its opening launch. i have signed a membership contract, and have made an upfront payment of 1 month membership fee + key fob fee.

would have appreciated if they stated their policies nicely, or displayed basic customer service skills.

attached a screenshot of the convo- no reply after i told them about my membership but went straight into questioning whether it was my friend who left a review on their page.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRbFk3S0dREAE

Anytime Fitness Mountbatten,Jeremy Chan,5,"Can’t believe I have yet to leave a review on this gym when this is basically my home AF gym & I’ve left so many reviews on other branches!

Anyway this is my home gym because it’s the closest gym to my home(Tanjong Rhu Road, right at the junction of Fort Road & Meyer Road) so because of that, I definitely hit this gym at least once a week. I have more time on my hands so I visit many other AF gyms but this gym will always be my ‘comfort’ gym.

It’s clean, equipment are all pretty much brand new & in pristine condition, the ambience & atmosphere is always conducive for a good workout. The staff are cordial & nice. Not much you can complain about this gym. Yes, some other AF gyms(the bigger ones) have more equipment & machines to play around with, but what they have at this gym is more than enough for an excellent workout.

A gym definitely worth 5 stars!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5d3I2LUdnEAE
