Anytime Fitness Tampines,Zeke,5,Cool place! Fatihi gave a good overview of the place for me and another staff (forgot to catch her name) gave me a real warm tour of the location! didn't have time to try out much due to general anxiety from crowd but looks p decently well equipped!,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s1UVNYZDRUVzlMWkUwd2VISkpZVlZVTWtRNFdtYxAB
Anytime Fitness Tampines,Jayvinn Wong,5,"Awesome gym! Spacious and clean, with a wide range of weight stack and plate loaded machines. Wished I was an Eastie so I can frequent this gym more :"")

Notable equipment:
- 2 x half racks
- 3 x full racks with attached platforms
- Plate loaded leg press
- Glute drive machine
- V squat machine
- T bar row
- Lateral raise machine
- Many pulldown machines (front pulldown, isolateral wide pulldown, regular pulldown, diverging lat pulldown)
- Many interesting handle variations for the cables",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwSE9FSkNhVmRaTm1Jd2NITkJSa1p0WjBSdVEwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tampines,Hasif Harun,5,"Finally got my first gym membership. It was a great experience with the staff that signed me up, Shahanah. It was fast, smooth and professional. Everything was explained to me directly and clearly, would highly recommend AF TAMPINES.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pOSU5tcHFWblJJYW5aRmJFODJPRGcwZGpGSVJVRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tampines,Justin,5,"the one true AF deserving of the tampines title. from L1 it looks really unassuming and seeing that it has been opened for quite awhile, one would think that the equipment would be rusty and some equipment faulty. however, stepping into this AF totally blew my mind, 3 rogue power bars + 3 deadlift platforms + 2 squat racks + 1 smith machine impressed me and made me justify the reason why I pay for premium fee for AF. i would rate the gym 4.5/5 stars.

the 0.5 stars room for improvement would be ensure that all equipments are working (only the stairmaster was not working when i visited). an important point to note would be that members are not allowed take off their shirts in the locker area as it is a shared space and sadly there would be no place to take your post-workout pump :( the group classes area is also criminally underutilized even though the mirrors there would be perfect for practicing bodybuilding poses! and this point can be subjectively viewed as either a positive or negative",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xReWRtVnBhMEZ3VlVjMFNtNHdSbEJRVEd4RVMyYxAB

Anytime Fitness Tampines,JayJay55,3,Good machines but the lights are blinding. After working out for a while you start to feel dizzy. You kinda need a hat while working out as when you are doing exercises while looking up it’s unbearable.

Anytime Fitness Tampines,Rick Ee,5,"Have been a member here for the past year. The outlet is large with a surplus of equipment and plates.

For a while, I thought they lacked quality legs machines and visited other gyms on Legs day. But they recently brought in new machines and extensions which I found to hit the spot.

My only gripe(s) is that the gym doesn’t receive much sunlight which they compensate with bright white lights. They also loop the same few no copyright music which sound pretty bad.

If you’re able to look past those little things, I think this outlet is the best in the East.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNMa3QyVzVRRRAB

My friends did not object, but while they were preparing to leave they were informed that they would be banned for an entire week. In what way is this fair to paying customers?

My friends did not damage any equipment, nor were they rude or violent towards staff, but were still slammed with a lengthy ban; which I presume they will still have to pay for a membership they cannot use. Horrid management.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCeGRhTGRREAE

Anytime Fitness Tampines,白Kane,1,"This is my honest review coming from a pioneer member that join during the early days (2017) since their last location was at Tampines North Community Centre. I witnessed how it all started off with their first stationed regional manager, Matt and their first in house trainer, Manfred. Then Alice and Safid came aboard with a few very friendly going intern like Berry. (We even had dinner to celebrate his last day before he entered NS). Over the course of years, I have watched both Alice and Safid getting promoted and taking on bigger responsibilities and roles.

The club was very professionally managed by Alice and Safid. I do visit the gym 6 days a week. It was a very friendly gym. Starting from AF staffs greeting you in and out of the gym (Heartwarming pleasant experience =) ). And then came COVID19. The gym had to be closed due to government regulations. The gym did care about their members and was kind enough to even loan out dumbbells and benches to work out at home.

After their shutdown of operation in October 2021 (Due to CC renovation), I tried to work out at other Tampines AF gym. But after two months of traveling, I finally came to decision to cancel this membership as I’m unable to commit to such traveling. I stopped hitting the gym for 8 months. I was elated to join back the gym in late July 2022.

Today 1st of September 2022, at or around 3pm – 3.30pm, while I was using the chest press machine, I was approached and reprimanded by their trainer, Sheikh by a condescending and rude tone, for slamming the weights. I was shocked and I immediately apologized to him for my negligence and explained to him that I had earbuds with noise cancelations effects, and I was pushing myself hard with one more max rep method. In a rude manner, he refused to accept my explanation and calls me giving excuses. He reprimanded me that I should have let the machine down slowly. I again explained I was pushing myself.

We both had a heated argument. During the argument, he used rude phrase such as “You believe that I can ask you to get out of the gym. I’m authorized to do”, threatening to order me to get out of gym during my workout. During the arguments, I accidentally tap his chest gently which apologized to him immediately it was unintentional but to my disbelief, I witnessed Sheikh responded by raising his fist and said “why you touch me, touch me again I will punch you”. I was even provoked and challenged to go to the manager room to continue this heated argument.

As a paying customer, I’m shocked to receive such a rude and rough approach from Sheikh. This is my first time that I have been reprimanded with such a harsh tone and barbaric body language and gestures coming from a AF staff. I been training the same way since 2017 with Tampines AF gym. No issues! Not even one verbal warning!

My point of view, as a staff representing AF, an international brand, trainer Sheikh was supposed to behave in a professional behavior in his workplace to be primarily respectful and demonstrate courteous conduct to provide a safe environment for gym goers(customers) to work out.  If Sheikh had took on a more professional approach and demonstrate polite gestures and body languages and accepting my first initial apology and explanation, none of this will have happened!

It was such a depressing awful experience for me as a customer to go through what I went through today. No paying customer should deserve to be treated like this!

From this incident, I deeply regretted to join back this gym considering that other gyms are offering competitive pricing with classes. One of main reason that convinced me to join back was that it is still managed by Safid and Alice. I guess all it took was one black sheep to destroy all the pleasant customer experience they have built from scratch.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajV2dDdRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Tampines,Chia Feng Yuan,1,"Today was looking forward to my first time visiting Tampines North CC Anytime Fitness outlet. But after reaching, me and my friend were told that we had to wait close to an hour to enter, and that the open slots were reserved for their home members. If we want to wait, we had to tap in using our token and scan the barcode displayed through their glass window.

I was very disappointed by the assistance and the customer service that this outlet displayed.

First of all, is it not that all Customers are able to access any outlets after the 1st month of membership application? So what is the difference between your home members and us? Aren't we all paying the same amount? We are all paying a monthly fee to gain access to the gym facilities and your services, but why should me and my friend get preferential treatment?

Second of all, the customer service is poor. When we were told to tap in using the token, and scan the barcode displayed through their glass window, and that is it. The service providers from this outlet, did not even brief us on what we should do after scanning the barcode. It took me 5 mins just to scan the barcode. After scanning, the barcode leads me to the whatsapp group, which then we do not know how to proceed.

Last of all, the service providers were not even friendly. I had been to 2 other outlets so far, and my experience with them were fantastic. The service providers from those 2 outlets were very friendly and engaging, they are always open for assistance. But i was utterly unhappy with the treatment and the service that the Tampines North CC Anytime Fitness portrayed, ruining my experience and the excitement of visiting a new outlet.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNpaVBhYzl3RRAB
