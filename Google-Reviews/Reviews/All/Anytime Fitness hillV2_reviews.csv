Anytime Fitness hillV2,Mohd Nasir,1,The gym is very big but the generosity of the owner is indeed very small. Unless you sign up for PT you can't use their body scan machine. Unlike the other AF I went to where they allow all to use as long as AF member,Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,Ma tt,1,"I’m not sure if the owner does read or act on the feedback given. It appears that the gym looks pretty much the same compared to before the revamping took place.

1. Lower the music. Even with noise cancelling earphones, the background music is extremely disturbing. It doesn’t help when the screens are playing other videos. The conflicting, blasting noise hurts the ears.

2. Lack of machines for bicep and abs. While there are free weights to cater to this, it will be great if there could be a greater variety of machines.

3. No hairdryer. The toilets came with only one bath area, one for each gender. Without the hairdryer, it can be very inconvenient if one is getting ready to head to work.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,litty x,2,"Quite accessible due to location and distance to MRT. However lacks in variety of equipment, understandably due to lack of space. However it might be worth investing in a weight rack perhaps?

Condition of the gym has dropped over the years, with corners of dirt and dust frequently being overlooked and a persistent general layer of grime on surfaces (not just equipment, willing to overlook due to frequency of use) even after the cleaners leave. Would be fine if they chose to close the gym every now and then just for a refresh.

Incredibly warm nearly all the time I visit.

However toilets are kept clean and people are also nice here.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness hillV2,Edward,5,"I just want everyone who uses this gym to know that the only reason why the air-conditioning isn't turned off at ~10PM is because in 2022, I emailed the management incessantly about it (""Anytime Fitness? Or Until 10PM Fitness?"") until they gave in.

You're welcome.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,Jayvinn Wong,3,"Came here on a weekend at 9am, and there were only 5 other people here.

Tldr: Great equipment for limited space, but v warm if you come early in the morning (before the aircon kicks in).

+ Limited space but they fit in a great selection of equipment. All the essential machines, cables, 2 full racks with attached platforms, and 3 addition half racks, as well as crossfit equipment like kettlebells.
+ Attached toilet and changing room facilities.
+ Plenty of sanitizing sprays and wipes provided.

- Came here during unstaffed hours, so no comment on service. However, the air conditioning was noticably lacking, with the room being very warm. It became better around 10.30am, so perhaps the air conditioning is on a timer.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,Christopher Bobin,5,"I've used many Anytime Fitness outlets in Singapore and HillV AF is one of the more solid AF facilities.  There's something for everyone here but the emphasis is on weights, with plenty of stations for bench, dead lift and presses.  The facility was recently renovated and a number of machines were added, particularly for targeting back and shoulder: a huge upgrade.  There are machines for legs and aeorobics as well.  Located in the HillV centre, there are a number of good restaurants, grocery and cafes nearby.  Highly recommended.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,S. Sulianah,5,"Another favourite branch. It is like the one in Greenwich V but feels like abit bigger here probably cos there are classes for this branch (if I am not wrong).

Anytime Fitness hillV2,Jerome Tong,1,"First impressions: convenient 24/7 gym, had all the required equipment and in decent condition, somewhat packed but didn’t require booking which was a big plus for me.

After ~1 year with the place: Weights left lying about on the floor, some equipment “out of order”, kettlebells’ paint peeling off and rusting. Photos attached

Side note on front desk staff - completely clueless on the booking system; allowing people who did not book to enter, and people with valid reservations can’t get in due to capacity, forcing them to wait outside for up to 30 mins during peak hours. Defeats the purpose of having a booking system.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,Juliana Seng,1,"Goods
- Threadmills are new. As well as the kind reminder sticker to not spray disinfecting liquid on the screen.
- Dumbbells are not rusty.

Bads
- Barbells looks very rusted.
- Plastic leather cover on some equipment looks worn out. Doesnt affect functionality, but can consider replacing.
- Only 2 bench press in front of the dumbbell racks and the minimal space in front of the mirror.
- Only 2 toilet with shower and 1 changing room
- Some fans at the corner are black with dust and in need of a wash.

Unacceptable
- I went at 840am, walked in and my first impression is that outside is way cooler than inside. Unbelievable. I searched for any aircon remote lying around, but alas, there was none.

The aircon looks like it is running, there are helpful paper strips stuck on the aircon to show that wind is indeed blowing out from the unit. The little paper strips just tells me that the aircon has been an ongoing problem.

As I run on the threadmill, some (conspiracy) theories floated in my mind. Maybe the aircon is centralized and the shopping mall has not turned it on yet. Maybe the aircon is on fan mode and not cool mode, and the management want to save aircon money. 9am, 915am, no signs of any centralised aircon switching on. There are more people and it is getting warmer and stuffier and I feel abit light headed. Maybe the oxygen in the room is decreasing too. Cant take it anymore, gonna hop over to another AF outlet.

On my way out, I pop over to the little employee office and asked if the aircon has always been like this. They mentioned they are aware of the issue, it is abit humid and are going to fix it.

Yeah, it is extremely warm, humid, stuffy and fixing it needs to be a top priority. Recommend they get portable aircon. And I am really salty that the employee office, enclosed in its glass walls and separated from the perspiring humans outside, is more cooling. Angry emoji.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness hillV2,Steve Demers,1,"Let me tell you a story of why you shouldn't use this location at HV2 and I never will again - I'll be telling everyone I know who lives around here too.

I travel a lot and make use of many different gyms abroad .

I've had an Anytime Fitness membership so that I can use their facilities when they are available abroad.  Often there's one nearby, I've never had a bad experience - until this one.

This location is actually near to my home but have never bothered to use it because our condo gym is decent and convenient to use by just walking downstairs.

Recently I decided to check out it though, maybe there's a couple of exercises that can add to my routines that would be beneficial.

After a very short time there I began to see the degradation of this facility.
Machines that seem to be perpetually broken, water fountain that is out of service, washrooms with equipment that just had a sign on them indicating they'll never be repaired, replaced or removed.

It's a bit of a dirty gym too.
There's layers of dirt in the corners from nobody cleaning for long periods.
There's spray bottles on the equipment with little rags to wipe with - but after a few days of seeing the exact same rags not being replaced or cleaned - I could tell that they seldom get changed out.  Several of them are brown from mildew and dirt...gross.

Pretty much every piece of padded equipment is fraying at the stitch seams.

This place may have been in good shape when HV2 opened but it's been maintained poorly.

Notwithstanding all of that I went for a few days because my membership is set to expire at the end of the month and I wanted to decide whether or not to renew again.  If I did then I'd start using this location.

Well...my last visit assisted in making that decision for me!

When attempting to use the cable rack I noticed a badly failed carabiner.  I'm sure you're familiar with them and what they do - also what a failed unit looks like.
This one wasn't returning to the lock position on its own after changing out grips.
This is a horrible accident waiting to happen, if someone uses it and it snaps (which they certainly do) it'll injure that poor soul very badly.

Having seen this before my 30 years of gym training I took off and went to see about getting a new one from the staff - whom the door says are available from 10 am.

I've asked for these to be replaced before at other gyms and they always have them available just in case - they're cheap equipment that is important.  It's good to have spares right?

It was 11 am - there was nobody to be seen.  So I placed the carabiner on the staff door handle.

At 11:18 I noticed a staff member came in.  While he was getting his keys out to unlock the staff office he saw the carabiner and picked it up to look at it.

I went over to explain where it came from and to ask for another one - I'd be happy to place it.

He hands it back to me saying that it's fine to use and that all I have to do is move the lock mechanism over by hand every time.

This was a bit shocking.  He was telling me to just keep using the dangerous failed carabiner!
I insisted that it should not be used and told him that someone could get hurt.  Still he told me it's fine.

I argued that a gym shouldn't have this sort of injury liability in their facility and he finally took it from my hand with a very grumpy look and mumbled something about getting one online.

Asking him how long it will take to be replaced he said with a very annoyed look that he had no idea and that he'll have to find somewhere to ""source"" one.

This was surprising!  Not only did this gym not have one but seemed reluctant to even place it on a priority so that members can continue use the facility fully.

As a joke and a test to see how far this will go I told the now angry looking fellow that ""How about I just buy one with my own money and bring it in then?""

He was quite agreeable to this with a ""okay that sounds good""

I'm not doing that!
Thank you Marcus for helping me decide to not renew my membership.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness hillV2,Jessica L,1,"I had great experiences at this gym, however, a recent situation happened to me that I had to give it a low 1 star.

So, I forgotten to bring my KeyFOB with me, and usually if it’s during staffed hours, they will manually registered me into the gym, no problem. However, today, they turned me away and said that they have a new “No KeyFOB, No entry” policy. I tried to reason with the staff but he did not give any wiggle room.

I find this completely unreasonable. It’s during staffed hours, it’s a super simple process and you will be doing your customer a huge favour. And don’t you want happy customers? I just don’t understand why can’t this be done.

Besides the adorable cleaning uncle, the management and logic of this gym is questionable and frustrating.

@Hillv2AF’sManagement, please consider lifting this policy at your gym. You’ll be doing us tired gym goers a huge help, when we made the effort to go to your gym and not be turned away. Thanks.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness hillV2,Varun Kapila,1,The treadmill has been out of service for more than a month.

Anytime Fitness hillV2,T Q,1,"Ladies, beware. This is the gym where you will find some of the rudest guys here who occupy gym equipment for more than 1 h (not exercising but just sitting at the side), some slam weights and others intimidate you. The female bathroom is always used by guys and now the gym decided to convert the one and only female toilet into a unisex one, with the male toilet beside it. Covid rules have been relaxed but they still refused to provide mats to users. Wouldn’t it be more unhygienic to lie on the floor?

A self-entitled guy even asked me to move away to another area while I was halfway through a workout, even though I was there first and used only 1 m2 of space. Not sure if he’s one of the staffs. There was a HUGE area where he already occupied with various equipment. He got angry when I ignored him and purposely hurled the weighted ball continuously while standing near me, it was absolutely dangerous and could have hit me. The staffs did nothing to stop him, or any other rude behaviours displayed by some of the members. There is a sense of sexism here in the gym.

I’m definitely going to switch my home gym. 😡",Date not found

21/11/2022: Service has definitely improved after interacting with Vanessa from the team. She has been super helpful and prompt in her follow ups.

21/09/2022: Very sad to revise this to one star.
- Had a 1 year fully paid membership which expired. I am happy to renew  but they could not accept the payment as register closed which is fine as it was 8pm ish and I cant use the facility that day even though I have been an advance paying member for a year and expressed the intent to renew.

- Scheduled to make payment on the weekend but activate it on 29th as I am travelling, but corporate policy does not allow that.

- No online payment.

Anytime Fitness hillV2,Hans Chan,5,"I'm surprised this gym got a streak of bad reviews previously? I think this gym has the most barbell racks I've seen in a AF gym (4 racks and 2 barbell stands on other end, and 2 deadlift platforms. And they have assault bike and concept2 rower as well. Perfect for people into free weight/power lifting/cross trainings. I can't review for machines cuz i don't care about those. Only hope to have is more benches for free weights.

Anytime Fitness hillV2,YH,3,"If you want to wear your masks at all times in the gym. Come here.

""WEAR YOUR MASK AT ALL TIME"". I was instructed by the gym trainer in a rather unfriendly tone when I visited there for the first time. Most other gym trainers in other locations were very very friendly. That's fine really, but the wording is wrong. WEAR YOUR MASK WHEN YOU ARE RESTING sounds better and more reasonable. But this is also disputable according to Singapore Covid rules because:

For indoor activities, masks may be taken off when performing strenuous
activity or as part of a class requirement but will have to be put on after the completion of such strenuous sporting and physical activity/class and during rest breaks.

And technically the entire workout session in any gym can be considered a single activity albeit with short breaks in between sets. But that's besides the point.

Anytime Fitness hillV2,Peanut Butter James Koh Z H,2,"So far the outward appearance looks pleasent. Clean gym, good equipment. Gym trainer are friendly. The good old days friendly management has gone. The 24hrs gym also gone at Hillv2. While other AF gym can function 24hrs. This is real disappoint too. Hillv2 still cannot find staff to stand in? Last time they even close at 8pm. They have no fix hour to gym. You never know when they are closing early. I'm their regular member in the past now I make my decision to move away from them I never regret. But the dark side is always unsound and have to be identify. Can see the hopeless look from the staff. The management team at Hillv2 is not as friendly, not reasonable not even customer centric. 2 stars was given to their poor service. This is one of the gym out of all the Anytime Fitness gym does not allow members to use there gym mats. Their reason was to reduce the spread of covid virus and they said that is sweat absorb. High risk. Question is why all other anytime fitness gym allow using the gym mats and statistic did not even show that gym mats will spread covid virus. Let's look at the statistic and don't give your own reason by reading artical that is not valid. Few months ago they even doesn't allow members to use the shower room. Same reason their own unrealistic answer the moisture in the toilet will speard the Virus. But when I check out with so many Anytime Fitness gym they did not restrict members to use it. If all the AF gym I visited does allow user to use the shower room and gym mats why This Hillv2 gym mamangment so poor in customer service and they suggest me to visit other gym? I'm OK to follow the rules but please make sure is standardise throughout all the AF gym. Even though is a franchise gym but it really sucks to had such an unrelistic reply from them. Even other AF gym manager also feedback to Hillv2 management and no one can do anything to them because they sound so bossy and they like to set their own unreasonable rules and never listen or take members feedback seriously. Are they too lazy to clean up the toilet or to clean the equipment or they just want to safe water bills? The same management team is handling jurong and yishun outlet. Since the incedient happen, I have not visit them till now. If they have open up those facilites, good for the gym user.
