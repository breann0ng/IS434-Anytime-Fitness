Anytime Fitness Bedok 200 North Ave 1,Mingwah Soh,5,"Signed up here at an opening promo coz it's just next to my block - super convenient. I find it quite a cozy gym, everything is neat and new, and the machines/ equipment just what I need in lieu of ActiveSG gyms which are getting pretty crowded nowadays, even had to queue for many machines!
The staff here are friendly and helpful too. I was also surprised they have a snacks corner with beverage, bread and spreads, in the level 1 weights department.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2psT1IyeGZaRzV3UTJ4NGNuRlNhRzEwVTJwNlZHYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bedok 200 North Ave 1,Jordan Mak,4,"This branch was just opened, it’s kinda small but it contains enough equipment for needs, just have to take note for visitors:

1. This gym is based with two areas, different floors, and you have to always holding the key fob if you wish to move another area.
2. The 1st level contains racks, dumbbells, cable machine and functional, while the second floor is mostly machine based equipment, pull up+dips and treadmills.
2. The washroom is only available at first floor as the publicly washroom at second floor is not yet available.

Hope this place would be better when I visit here next time! Especially the public washroom is available on second floor. 😅

P.S.: This recreation centre is still in construction so be careful if you visiting there.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25oRFRHZDNRa2hHVlZReWJYQldUWEF3UVhOUlEzYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bedok 200 North Ave 1,Ling,4,"Music can be improved. Suggest to air radio stations if dont wanna pay for the  license.
There are times when the right plates are left on the machines. Suggest to put up notices to remind users to put back the weight plates for the next user.
Would be great if there's a water cooler on the 2nd floor too.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xVd05VZHBjREJmWjBwdFlUSjZWVEZrV1hwb1ZHYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bedok 200 North Ave 1,danial james,2,"I feel the gym is alright , machine wise all are okay and new but because it’s a new gym but then the fact that i have to travel up and down to go to different sections of the gym i find it not practical and to be honest if i was doing legs or wanting to do a quick workout i dont think this will benefit me… i been to AF Bedok mall and Bedok 537 , i still got to say , if you like a more homely feeling in the gym , AF Bedok 537 is the one to go to , although abit small but machine is well kept and also got many machines that are unique not too pack as well , AF Bedok mall the bar was rusty the plate weights are chipped and machine look like pass down from centuries … literally have 3 different gens of treadmill",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT205cmVFNUhjRzFwTkV0QlJVeEdkVXBLYVdKRmRYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Bedok 200 North Ave 1,Gary Ang,5,"Visited once during a Sat evening, super quiet, only like 6 pax during my 2 hours of training. The second part of the gym is on the second floor, a little bit of walking but no complaints from me, I'm there to workout, clocking a bit more steps is all good",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25rd1YwTnlaRTh6TjJ0dmVHeEJOa0V3UVdWWlZrRRAB
