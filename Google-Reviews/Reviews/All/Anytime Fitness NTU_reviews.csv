Anytime Fitness NTU,Kenny Yap,4,"Everything is so clean and new. Limited parking at night but in the day it’s awesome to be able to park and just walk right across into the gym. Downside is the stretching area is relatively small and has no soft padding. Also doesn’t have some more commonly found equipments like kettlebells, stretch bands, wallballs, leg straps.

Upside is abundance of squat racks and deadlift platforms with a lot of 20kg plates. Full range of dumbbells up to 50kg. Cardio machines are the latest kind with big screens. There’s also 2 rowing machine although it’s not the same as the ones used at hyrox.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwRFpXeGxVVlpYZVRWdlkyRklkSFIxZEZadmJHYxAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,y y,5,"There are a variety of machines in this shop. and they were carefully arranged, making it easy to train.

The toilets and showers were located outside the store, just like in other stores across the country, but they were able to be used without any problems.

The staff were also very friendly.

I'll go again!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2kxd1dHcGpjSEYwU201NGRrVkdNbnBKZW5CTFdGRRAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Lim Jie,2,"There were good equipments in the gym. But contrary to what the anytime fitness app says, they do not have private showers, the only showers are the Campus showers. Thus, there is no hot water, soap and shampoo provided. Please remember to bring your own!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xob2NVMTFlV1JYU1c4MFNGWmZOMlY0UkRGdmIwRRAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,januce,1,"good variety of weights and equipments. BUT very rude staff(s), not just once but twice for calling people out loudly as others are enjoying their workouts. really kill the vibes and momentum.

try to understand that gymbros here are trying to clock our workouts and we have basic gym etiquettes that we will return the weights AFTER we finish the workout or even sharing with others.

saw how the staffs are walking around PATROLLING as though we are trying to do something with the equipments here.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xGRVZGTm1hMUJOY25oak5URkJOek5XV1MwdFRXYxAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,D A,5,"the gym environment at NTU is honestly amazing. there’s a great range of equipment, and i’ve always been able to find what i need for my workouts. one small suggestion would be to consider adding a few step boards as i find it challenging to place my feet firmly on the ground when doing chest press on the plate loaded machine. other than that, no complaints at all and the staff are friendly and approachable :)",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25wdVdqVk1TM0E1T1Y5bVV6bDViRTFyWjNadGMzYxAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,yr0304,5,"This is a great gym with excellent equipment! Although it doesn't have its own shower, I was able to use the shared showers right outside, so it wasn't a problem for me.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pCb1dHOVRVVmx6YTNGaVVWOVJMVVpwVEV4dFdXYxAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Elvin Chng,2,"Everything you expect of a brand-new gym, but I didn’t expect not having a private shower in the gym itself. The shower facility is shared with the stadium, which the condition is less than ideal.

Updates after the owners' reply.
I understand that there are building restrictions. You should remove Private Restrooms and Private Showers from your website under Gym Amenities.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pCcFduTndNVVV0WTFkcGRFRlZZVkJWU1RkcWMwRRAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Ron Ng,5,This gym is brand new and spotless! There’s a ton of different equipment to choose from. The staff are super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it! It’s definitely a 5-star gym.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tOelpuWkJOVUU0VTB4M2JYVkhlR2RoVTFSdFJtYxAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Yeo Yeo,1,"My credit card was stolen, and I had to replace it with a new one. During this time, I wasn’t able to update my payment information right away. As a result, I was charged a late fee, even though the delay was due to circumstances beyond my control. I would have appreciated more understanding or at least a grace period. Disappointed with how this was handled.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25sbFdpMHRlV1ZDUVRKSVJtRlhRbmRLWkdNMmVrRRAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Lutfil Haady,5,"One of the better AF with very diverse equipment. Plenty of racks(best part).

Personally as an NTU student, it is very convenient as I don’t have to travel far.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT201dFpHZHJNa2RhYWxNeVYwdFRWME5LZURkTU5VRRAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Luo Chao Jun,5,Very solid equipment. Just suggesting that adding an eleiko bar would cater better to the competitive lifters. Maybe add some extra step pads to cater to shorter people.,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xRNVZUUkhSek4yYTBOdk1USTRaemRSYkd0b1ExRRAB
Anytime Fitness NTU,Poot Poot,1,Rmbr to put back ur weights here because the staff here take this very seriously and would call u out loudly like as if u committed a crime. Did not apologise when they call out by mistake too. Hope they can improve in their customer service…,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21OMmJuaHVNVmxvTTFrMVpHSnVkVWhEUVV4bE4wRRAB
