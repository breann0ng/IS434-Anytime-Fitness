Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Jake Lo,2,"It’s overall decent. Not the best AF branch, but it does have the things you need. A bit on the small side, and can get cramped in some areas. This is mostly due it being in a mall, and for the same reason the peak hours make this space excessively crowded and you’re honestly better off going somewhere else for your workout if it’s a peak period time slot.
Update: Their music choices are the worst out of all the AF’s I’ve been to. And because of the volume they cut right through your own earphones. Also the exposed ceiling area (fixtures and pipes) needs a good clean.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2twVFMweFpPVzFrYjBkQlpFZFdXRTVLZFVWRWNHYxAB

Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Vikas Sokhal,1,"The dirtiest branch of anytime fitness

Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Fariha Roselan,2,"This AF is not my base gym, I use this gym time to time only. And usually I find the facilities adequate. However, on my visit today, the toilets smell very strongly of pee.  Both toilets.

I understand it's a Sunday and there is no staff/cleaning team etc. Honestly, I don't fully blame the staff as I can see there is a ""Toilet Checklist"" that they follow.

I call out the culture of the gym goers here. If you can lift heavy, if you can run long distances, but you can't clean up after yourselves.. are you okay?

While you up your PRs, you can also up your social awareness/hygiene. Thank you for your kind attention.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2cGFUV2N3EAE
Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Caroline Chua,5,"If you ladies are looking for a trainer, I will highly recommend Jannifer. After my training sessions with her the first round, not only have I gotten stronger, but I can also see results. Jannifer not only became a important part of my fitness journey, but also became a friend 😊 Most importantly, she knows her stuff well, and has a thorough understanding of the targeted areas that needs to be improved. All in all, I did 2 packaged sessions with her through the year and it’s been life changing ever since. Growing stronger together 💪🏽",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRbzdPVzFnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Shalesh Prana,5,"A Testament to Incredible Coaching – My Fitness Journey

I highly recommend my personal trainer Jannifer  at Anytime Fitness (East Point Mall) for her exceptional dedication and expertise.

Her guidance has been instrumental in helping me get closer to my personal fitness goals. She always prioritizes my safety during our training sessions while still challenging me to push beyond my perceived limits. Her ability to motivate and encourage me, even when I don’t realize what I’m capable of, has been truly transformative.

She is a master of her craft, demonstrating both skill and passion in every session. Beyond being an outstanding trainer, she has also been a great source of support and encouragement. I truly appreciate her efforts, both as a coach and as a friend.

The results speak for themselves! After just 7 weeks, I can see and feel the difference. This transformation would not have been possible without her dedication and belief in my potential.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRLWRuaXV3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Nobu,1,"The culture here consist of arrogant users who slam their weights unnecessarily, leave load of weights on the plate loaded machine for the next user to clear up for them before they can use.

No real enforcement of gym etiquette from staff.
Last I know, good at checking tailgaters only.
Blurred/worn out poster noting members to track the weights. Who’s gonna bother about poster let alone a blurry one?

Weight plate are always stacked wrongly. Worsening the aesthetics of the gym.

Rusty barbell that haven’t been settled since my first entry. Risking the safety of the members should one got cut by the rusty surface.

Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Satish Rajaraman,5,"Spacious and smartly equipped gym! 4 barbell racks, a smith machine and a lifting platform mean no waiting time to do your weights. Love the recent additions - a linear squat machine and decline press machine. Have never seen any equipment being out of order. The staff and other members are quite amiable and easy going. Love the vibe!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5cjVyRlFBEAE
Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Zinc Tan,1,"The gym is getting seriously cold and overcrowded machines-wise. It used to be simple and functional but perhaps it’s over subscribed. They also don’t listen to gym members’ feedback about machines or temperature. The flow of AC is directly blowing at a specific machine.
1. When the temperature is too cold and you’re exercising, you’re very prone to injuring yourself.
2. The issue was at a specific machine. They could have very easily moved the machine very slightly (even 10cm) and the flow of AC would be less strong.
3. They could have responded with saying that they’ll check what can be done.
4. They could’ve put something else in place (a shelf?) to diffuse the AC flow.

Updated September 2024:
I have been with the gym since COVID. The machines have gotten increasingly packed and the use of space isn’t well thought out. They clearly have a lot of patrons and can afford to expand the space to manage this issue. You’re quite likely to bump into another user, even at emptier timings. Imagine someone bumping into you while working out because they’re not careful. The machines are also not well-maintained. I’m often left wondering about my safety. I’m not sure where my monthly payments are going towards for a service fee? What services are being provided?

This gym was also under renovation for a while and members were not notified via email or sms. Payments were still being deducted despite the lack of access to the gym. Their reasoning was putting up signs at their gym, so users should have known. And yes, I can go elsewhere, but obviously I chose this gym for its location? You should at least offer to freeze payments or make sure there is a blast to all customers. Was it the customer’s decision to do a renovation despite the potential disruption? No, it was the gym’s. I’m sure there might have been customers who were overseas and missed the signage.

Not only all of the above issues, but delayed payment penalties not due to the user’s end - checked with my credit card - is still the user’s responsibility to follow up with their payment vendor. And after the gym realised it was an issue for many customers (after one week), they continued to threaten me with an additional late fee (so x2) whilst I was waiting for their payment to respond. All this while, they did not bother to support my request for investigation. In fact, they were dismissive and apathetic to my issue that was caused by them.

Lastly, their website clearly states that anytime fitness clubs are independently owned and operated. Therefore, all of these issues could have been alleviated by this franchise’s management, but they are actively choosing not to do so.

Don’t expect any service or support at this gym. Expect the bare minimum, slightly rusty equipment, bad use of space, and smelly restrooms. It used to be a friendly environment where I could head in and say hi to the staff. Now they don’t care at all and refuse to take responsibility. Honestly all of these issues are way too silly and took too much of my time and energy to even write down. But it’s exactly because it’s a completely ridiculous situation that it shouldn’t have happened and deserves to be recorded for other users to be aware of.

If you’re looking for a gym in the east, Tampines has 3 AFs, and they were highly responsive. FYI.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUX1A2UTd3RRAB

Kelvin, the PT manager, has been incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, providing me with valuable fitness insights. Xavier, the manager, assisted me with registration in a smooth and detailed manner, his professionalism managing his teams was outstanding. Jennifer, the PT, is not only amazing but also enthusiastic in sharing fitness tips. Arif and Syah, the brand ambassadors, have been motivating and welcoming, making my gym experience more enjoyable.

I would also like to mention Wiyah, the intern, whose outstanding PR skills have contributed positively to the atmosphere at the gym.

Anytime Fitness Eastpoint Mall,Dap A,2,"I've been a member of Anytime Fitness for just two months, and I've already faced issues with the EZpay platform used for monthly membership fee deductions. While the staff at Anytime Fitness are polite, the management's insistence on using EZpay, despite numerous customer complaints, is baffling.

In my second month, I was hit with a $15.26 late fee because EZpay claimed my bank rejected the transaction. After checking with my bank, it was clear there were no issues on my end—no failed, frozen, or rejected transactions. Yet, Anytime Fitness insists I pay the late fee to avoid another charge by the 8th of the month. This is extremely frustrating, especially when no action is taken to resolve this / waive off my fees, and instead, to ""force"" me to make the late fee asap, otherwise, my access to AF is revoked. Even the staff admitted that refunds / waivers by EZpay after making the late fee payment for customers who were wrongly charged were always unsuccessful. A quick google search on EZpay SG showed that their results are consistently poor, with a 1-star rating and a long history of customer complaints.

EZpay and Anytime Fitness seem to be caught in a blame game, with EZpay pushing the fault onto the merchant and AF pointing fingers back at EZpay. In the end, it's the customer who bears the cost of the late fee THROUGH NO FAULT of ours, which is ridiculous. As a new customer, this leaves a bad taste in my mouth, making me question my decision to join. It's disappointing that Anytime Fitness management continues to use such a flawed platform, putting their customers through unnecessary hassle and fees. AF should reconsider their choice of payment platform soon, or absorb the late fee charges since they are insistent on continuing with this faulty platform.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIeVpPdDFRRRAB

When they did contact me and asking if i can come down to discuss membership I answered and did not receive a response
