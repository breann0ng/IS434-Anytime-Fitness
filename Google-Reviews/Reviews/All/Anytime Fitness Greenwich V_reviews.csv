Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Roger Thomas Tan,5,"Great place with nice glass walls that allow you to peek at the nice greenery outside! Crowd is manageable and you always have space to use the weights you want! Nice little locker area decorated pleasantly which is unique of this gym. Fellow gum users here are great! Down to earth and humble, makes using the gym a really nice experience!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4MTViOXZ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Alex,3,"The gym is overall decent. It’s not the largest space, but they’ve managed to fit in quite a fair number of equipment options, which is both a plus and a minus depending on how busy it gets. The environment is clean and generally well-maintained.

However, one thing that stood out and not necessarily in a good way is the excessive number of rule notices plastered around the gym. There are signs of $30 fines for various reasons. It feels quite regimental and overly bureaucratic, which can take away from the otherwise positive gym experience.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2toMFJqZG5TRU15VUZCVlNUY3hPRTlRVTNocFptYxAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Ralph Ong,2,"This gym is great, has all the essentials you need but no fancy equipment like lateral raise and the cable machine is a little old and hard to move but it has all necessities. The only caveat is that the music in this gym is just really bad and it is hard to focus because half the time i’m just curious about what goofy song is playing. Would be great if the playlist could swicth up once in awhile",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21adFJHVkxiSHA2WVVoMWRsaEhYelZwVDI5bVdrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Suraj Dubey,1,"My first time being to this outlet and I've got to say this gym does not fall short of rules. One of the staff was quite rude to me regarding it. According to her, i was slamming the weight plates on one of the machine.
On the good note, gym is small but clean and they even provide body spray in the rest room.
However I'll not recommend.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNILTR2NkhBEAE
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Gary Ang,4,"This is a small gym located in the northeast side. It's small, but it has everything you need to workout. It would be nice if they have more stacked weight machine but given the space is small, it can be tough. Cable machine area is a little bit cramped.  Not every AF gym has toilets and this AF has it! There's a bus stop 3min walk away from this location, parking within the mall.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURadHVxekdBEAE
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Daryl Venpin,5,Great Anytime Fitness with all the basic equipments you need to get pumped! Really lovely management and community. They also have monthly fitness challenge and prizes. It is a small /medium size gym and it is very clean & tidy ...  Good Job!,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5X3RybVV3EAE
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Jean Jean,1,"Title: Disappointing Experience

I recently went to AF @Greenwich and I must say, I'm quite disappointed with my experience. First and foremost, the layout of the gym is absolutely terrible. The equipment is crammed into small spaces, making it difficult to navigate. There's barely enough room to stretch or move around, and I often found myself waiting to use machines that were too close to each other.

Moreover, the atmosphere is less than welcoming. Some of the members have a very off-putting attitude, creating a vibe that's far from friendly. It’s frustrating to see people hogging machines while others are waiting, and the lack of gym etiquette among certain members just adds to the negative experience.

Overall, I expected much more from AF @Greenwich. The poor layout and unpleasant atmosphere make it hard to enjoy working out. I would not recommend this gym to anyone looking for a positive fitness experience.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQzZ19HVXF3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,sh1rako,3,"I have been to this gym since i started my gym membership but have since moved my main gym to one that is closer to my workplace. After my experience there and coming back here from time to time, I have decided to leave a review on my experience at this gym.
First off, the gym is a very newbie-friendly gym with very good air conditioning, its often very cold in here compared to other gyms. It is clean and the equipment here are in very good condition. The staff based on my experience are generally very nice and passionate individuals. In the locker area, there are perfume sprays for members to freshen after their sessions that can be used for free. Lastly, their toilets are very clean and well maintained.
However, especially during weekday peak hours (5-7pm), the gym can get very crowded to the point that navigating the free weights area could be a nightmare. Also, with my recent visit, i noticed that there is a huge increase in the number of rules and fines plastered all over the gym, which i do not see in other gyms, some of rules like wearing adequate footwear is fine but for something like changing the grip of the lat pull down machine is kind of excessive in my opinion. Lastly, i have one, albeit a personal gripe, which is the general lack of cable machines. There is just one machine but most of the time it is always being used and especially during peak hours, will have people queueing  up to use it.
All in all, this gym is generally a good and quite gym go to and do your workout, but there is bound to have some rooms for improvements.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYOEtIQlhBEAE
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,William Lu,5,"A small gym center, it has all the basic gym equipments and opens 24hours. It is located at level 2 of Greenwich V which at open area - not inside the mall - the access is not limited by mall opening hour. One of the shops around is opened 24 hours - the coffee shops (forgot the name of the shops).",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NGRUT05REAE
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,S. Sulianah,5,My first time tried this branch was at 3am on one of the weekends. It is a very quiet place no one there at that time and very serene with comfortable silence. It is in a nice neighbourhood too. Equipments are new and well taken care. One of my favourite Anytime Fitness branch.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNdElyNTd3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Gina,4,"The gym is very clean and filled with essential equipment for a good workout. Stairmaster, back extension usually gym size like that’s wouldn’t have. The shower area even have free body mist and men deodorant for members to use!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNicnNIX2pBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Maan Yul,5,"I relocated and now really missing this place. I’ve been to larger or more accessible gyms but this is where I usually frequent to. I dont know if it makes sense for a gym but it has that “homey” vibe - it’s small but functional, comfortable and community is generally nice. I should point out it’s the cleanest and most well maintained branch I’ve been to.

Finally, kudos to their kind and considerate staff or management. I’ve been to a little mishap on a holiday and they were very prompt to address my issue.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOeTltcDRnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Terry Samuels,5,Amazing place! I love the 3 bosses! They are the only owners who made me feel good despite not being a regular member. Most of the other AF gym owners give off a very ego sizing vibe whenever I try their outlets.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMXF6c3dBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Andrew Wilfred,5,Gym is small and equipment somewhat limited. But it's a great space and you have access to all the equipment you really need. It's an incredibly functional and effective workout space. Sam manages the unit and can always be trusted to greet you with a smile. Other staff are also on the ball and during COVID they made entering and exiting the place smooth as butter.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyak1QQ2dBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Benjamin Tay,5,"Thankful for the Team behind AFGV!
Been a member here since 2018, and they’ve been superb since Day 1! 👏👏👍 …",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwd1o3X1h3EAE
Anytime Fitness Greenwich V,Deborah Guo,5,"Cosy and safe space for a workout if you’re around the Greenwich area.

Grateful to Joy for being so accommodating even to non-home club member like me. To my dismay, I’d left my house without my key fob and she was kind enough to allow me in after verifying that I’m a paying member. A membership truly allows you to workout anywhere in SG and worldwide without fuss. Time is no longer an excuse 😌

Note they’ll be closed for a full renovation from feb 6-28th so faster check ‘em out while you can. Can’t wait to see how the refreshed space looks like :)

Thanks to Joy and team again, was a superb workout!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCaTRTNUFREAE
