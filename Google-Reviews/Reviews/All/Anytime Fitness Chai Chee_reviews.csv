Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Sihan Goi,5,"Came here over lunchtime from 12 to 2pm on a Wednesday and it was not too crowded. This is a very powerlifting centric gym. There are only power bars - a range of Eleiko, Rogue and HS Power bars. The Rogue are in lbs. There are no hybrid bars nor weightlifting bars, but at least all the bars spin. I lifted with the Rogues - the centre knurlings are brutal. Equipment wise, there are 6 half racks and 2 full racks, 3 platforms, and at least 1 bar per rack/platform. Ziva bumpers (only 10kg, 20kg and a couple 5kg). There are also some old metal PL plates in the office. Loads of plate loaded and cable machines, cardio equipment, a large warmup area. Generally it's huge and open with no narrow corridors or areas, a good layout for a gym. Access is either via lift lobby to the right of Harvey Norman (when you're looking at it), or you can take the stairs/escalators from Harvey Norman to level 2 and exit to go to the gym. There is a shared unisex bathroom with a few female only stalls, sinks and Dyson hair dryers, but there are no toilets in the gym (there are public toilets outside the gym). Quite a nice gym that's well stocked in terms of equipment, but would've liked some WL/hybrid bars at least.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GT2NGVlVSRzlZVlZCa2NsSlRNVlJ3T1VORmVrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Jack,4,"One of the better gyms in the east. Space is huge and well spaced apart. Plenty racks and free weights and most of the machines are precor, which is different from those I'm more familiar with using hammer strength. There is also a free to use body composition scale, where most other gyms will be only accessed by gym staff. Surprised though while changing room is spacious there is only one water dispenser which doesn't dispense cold water? Or maybe I don't know how to operate.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMT3Z0cGZfM1o2Rm1nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Ralph Gerard Ramirez,5,"Really nice gym with great machines and facilities. Locker room is spacious with shower facilities, toilets and hair dryers.

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Raiyan See,5,"been an AF member for 2 years plus now and have spent a lot of time trying out new gyms. to date I've visited over 30 AF branches in singapore and AF Chai Chee is still my favourite branch to visit.

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Cherzinga,1,"2nd time here, both times I got an allergic reaction on my hands using the machines. My hands and fingers were swelling I had to get medicine after. Today I found out why. I saw the cleaning uncle and I saw how he wiped the machines. He wiped everything EXCEPT the contact points (where my hands are supposed to go). Im paying you to clean well, not to give me an allergic reaction. Never coming back again. I didnt have this problem at the kembangan outlet ever

His shift: 4pm 20 Jun 2025

Also the rowing machine doesn't work",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GeUxXVjBWRzlaYVVkV2RsWm9XRVJRV0dkSlJYYxAB

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Deon Lim,5,"Probably the biggest (and most impressive) gym in the area. Located at Block B L2 of ESR Biz Park, it houses a wide variety and availability of exercise equipment so there’s something for everyone. Changing area and washrooms are unisex (yes they have Dyson hairdryers). There’s no excuse to not have a good workout, lots of potential in this joint. There’s no parking space at this block so head over to Block A or E. Bryan is cool.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1bWMzNXFRRRAB

Gym is well equipped with a variety of machines for strength-training and cardio, and a free weights area, and for the most part, is not so crowded as to have to wait to long to use the machines.

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Daryl Wang,5,"I recently joined Anytime Fitness Chai Chee, and I must say, it has been an amazing experience! From the moment my colleague and I stepped into the gym, we were warmly welcomed by the team, and the overall vibe was fantastic.

A special shoutout to Koji, the manager, who played a huge role in our decision to sign up immediately. His professionalism, friendliness, and genuine enthusiasm for fitness made us feel confident that we were making the right choice. He took the time to understand our goals, walked us through the facilities, and ensured that we felt comfortable and excited to begin our fitness journey.

The gym itself is well-equipped, clean, and has a great environment that makes working out enjoyable. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced gym-goer, this place has everything you need.

I highly recommend Anytime Fitness Chai Chee to anyone looking for a welcoming and supportive gym community. And if you’re lucky enough to meet Koji, you’ll see why this branch stands out!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUN3cTZIamZnEAE

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Daniel Ng,5,"My favourite AF by far, huge space and tons of power racks. The best pieces here are the Panatta Hack Squat, Precor Leg Press/Leg Extension and the Precor Jungle with lots of cable attachments. Been training here for over a year and it's really comfortable to go to early in the morning. Gym can get pretty crowded during peak hours (6pm onwards).

Edit (2024): They've since added a Panatta pendulum squat and it feels amazing, less axial loading and very comfortable to get full ROM!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsbWQzMmhBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Goh Brennan,5,"Just to give you a background on my attendance to AF Gyms. I gym everyday, like literally 7 days a week. For the past almost 1 year because I wanted a body transformation for my health sake.

In my visitations to various gyms upon weekends with my wife, I believe AF Chai Chee win a lot of other locations hands down in the east sector. Why so?

1. Equipment is good and have extensive stations to workout specific muscle groups.

2. It has a very spacious spread and I don't feel like people are intruding on my space.

3. It has multiple deadlift stations for those legs and back goers.

4. It's super clean and tidy

5. The spacious wash/changing room.

6. The vending machine is always stacked and filled with no issues of getting the protein shakes I need.

What's more needed to say about a gym?

Go Chai Chee ! 💪🏻😎",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJbWZiRTZBRRAB

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,WS Yong,1,"Poor service. Don’t know how come the refund supposed to be received at the end of month yet I had to keep chasing. Seems like manager Koji or his team conveniently forget or delay stuff like cancelling membership or issuing refunds. How do u expect ppl to keep being a home gym member with this kind of disgusting behaviour? Really disappointing, absolutely time wasting , and annoying

Edit: even was asked to remove the review, said he may get fired. Why guilt trip the customer? Why is it only after I do this, I can get refund immediately, despite waiting for a month or so, and having to waste time chasing?

Everytime i enter the CHAI CHEE AF room door, the AF staff will greet me. Everytime i exit the gym, AF staff say 'bye rest well or just goodbye' Super welcoming & friendly. Even the toilets they do provide services. Cmon, they offer Pads for our women gymmers. How nice is that? Overall, I like AF. 24hours. Even tho abit ex la horh, but thats not an excuse to not gym they say 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 I will commit 🙏🏽",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3eklDVWNBEAE
Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Jun Ya Tan,5,"Best AF gym I have visited so far. It's super spacious and has great variety of equipment available. It has a spacious functional area for warm ups and bodyweight exercises, 2 smith machines, multiple squat racks and deadlift platforms, hack squat, pendulum squat, glute drive machine, etc. There are many powerlifters training here so it can be abit intimidating but the space and variety of equipment available definitely outweighs that.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiemJ1Y3lRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Ian Mak,5,"A wonderful and pristine location for getting an awesome training session! This gym is fully equipped with numerous training equipments that tailor to different population demographics, ranging from powerlifters to bodybuilders, to the weekend warriors and casual lifters!

Being one of the larger Anytime Fitness outlets in Singapore, the facility is spacious and inviting, offsetting one of the common complaint many people have with most training facilities. The staff are also very sociable and accomodating, and are always willing to listen to the members' feedback with regards to any matter. Showering and changing facilities are also significantly more spacious than most other outlets, which adds to the overall comfort and feel of the place as well.

All in all, I cannot recommend Anytime Fitness Chai Chee enough. I have zero regrets on changing my home gym to this outlet, and I intend to stay with this outlet for the rest of time spent training.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR0eEw3UHpnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,tan mingkai,4,"Largest AF i've been to, had alot of great equipment,

+ abundance of squat racks, like 6 or 8 of them

+/- 5 Deadlift platforms are also more than most but the platforms are configured abit awkwardly where theres one in the middle and on either sides there are 2 that are inches away from each other, i'd say they should rotate them 90 degrees and have them in a row spaced farther apart but I dont know enough about owning a gym to make that recommendation.

+ Other than the typical selection of machines that all AFs have they also had some Panatta equipment so if you like variety they're good.

+/- Pretty serious gym despite all the controversy when it first opened, but with all serious gyms, you get your intimidating atmosphere and yelling when PRs are hit so do be emotionally and mentally prepared.

+/- Changing room/ toilet is relatively large, can get a bit untidy what with all the various lifting belts and shoes people bring with them, large mirrors for your selfies.

Went on a Friday evening, moderate attendance, some people trying their best to do a hyrox challenge.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURiemZHWmJnEAE

I can say without hesitation, that this is the BEST gym I’ve personally used here in Singapore! It is spacious, has new high-end equipment and its free weight and power lifting equipment is unmatched ANYWHERE.

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Jeremy Chan,5,"Too bad I took a video & not any photos and somehow am unable to load the video up probably because of the size?

They have enough space to make you feel comfortable; they have a huge array of equipment, machines and free weights. They have many different sorts of bars for free weight exercises. They have machines I have never seen in SG throughout my years of being a gym rat.

Staff are helpful and friendly as well which is a huge plus of course. All in all this gym definitely deserves a 5 upon 5 star rating. They have a few machines & cables out of order but I have spoken to the trainers who told me they have already requested for replacements/repairs. That would only increase their already superb gym. In any case the machines they already have which are in order are already more than enough & more than in any other gym I’ve seen here in SG. For the time being this is my favorite AF gym here in SG!

Anytime Fitness Chai Chee,Hamid,4,"Lack of signage anywhere within the 4 blocks located there, may make it very hard for some to find it.

Location:
AFCC is located in the building next to Decathlon (on its left), where the Harvey Norman outlet is. Enter via the lift lobby, located at the front of the building. Take the lift to the 2nd floor. Upon exiting the lift, turn left and take a left again. Walk straight down, you'll see AFCC on your right.

Parking:
Parking at Viva B.P. is option 1,but cheaper option would be to turn into the HDB carpark further down the road, from the turn to enter Viva business park.

Layout:
spacious. Floor space quiet well utilized with good placement of equipment, machine and racks.

Equipment:
4 squat racks (if I counted correctly), and plenty of space to do compound movements like deadlift, clean and jerks etc.

Amenities:
this is where, to me honestly, they could have done better. A unisex locker room, is fine. But for a unisex toilet and shower area to be incorporated into the locker area, not such a good idea.
Total lack of privacy as the weight lifting area is right in front of the locker area.
Only 1 water cooler for such a massive gym, is quite a surprise for me personally.
Lack of shelf in the shower area is also quite distressing. No shower screen installed, so the shower area cum changing area will be very wet after someone showers.
Plus point is that there are sinks and mirrors along the wall, with hair dryers.

VERDICT:
All in all, a solid gym and kickass equipment with space (rare in SG).",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1d0tia253RRAB

It’s the biggest one I think near Bedok.
But there are quite a lot of people there on weekends
Compared to community-based Anytime Fitness,
Fixed equipment is very abundant
However, I think the cleanliness of the toilets and environment could be improved.

The location is not easy to find. After walking in, you have to go to the second floor.
But the instructions were not very clear. It took me a while to find them for the first time.

The water dispenser is relatively advanced and is sensor-based, which is very good.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNObTVXVW53RRAB
