Anytime Fitness ACE The Place CC,i love tulips (tulips),1,"Honestly, one of the worst, if not the worst experience I have had ever at a gym. Was working out halfway, and one of the staff started to hardsell me some training package, telling me that if I don’t get it today, the price would be different the next time. At some point, they wouldn’t even let me leave unless I buy the package.

Anytime Fitness ACE The Place CC,Zhou Qing,1,"Disappointed with my recent experience at this Anytime Fitness outlet. During my visit, I encountered aggressive hard selling from the personal trainers, who dismissed my prior training experience without properly understanding or assessing my current workout routine. Instead, they pushed for an expensive training package costing over $3,000, which felt more like a sales tactic than genuine guidance.

Additionally, I was asked to make a downpayment equivalent to three months of membership fees, on top of the standard joining fee and key fob cost. I was told this was a new policy, yet other members who signed up over a year ago were not required to make such a large upfront payment and were allowed to pay monthly instead. This inconsistency in policy and lack of transparency is frustrating and left me feeling misled.

I hope the management takes this feedback seriously to ensure a more respectful, transparent and consistent approach moving forward.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness ACE The Place CC,Clems G,3,"3/5 ⭐ only because this place has basic enough gym equipment, aircon, and toilet/changing room w/in gym premises.
If you think a passing grade is ""ok"" for this gym, you're better off visiting the ActiveSG gyms - they're more affordable and have basically everything this gym already has (and more gym equipment), w/o eating up your 80$++ keyfob money upon registration and monthly gym membership fees.

The fans in this gym never seem to be used, and have their casings dismantled and left at a corner (regardless of time of day, or day of the month).

Have personally visited this gym multiple times on weekdays AND weekends on different months w/in the year and have not yet seen the fans being used at all.

If you want to experience what it's like exercising outdoors while being indoors, this is the gym to go to, because it can make you sweat quite easily w/o much exertion during your exercises.

A year ago, the toilets were pretty dirty but during my recent visits here, the toilet has been more tidied up. However, despite having built-in lockers/cabinets in each toilet for members to store their personal items, some are locked away.

Wrt my prior knowledge, the lockers were locked away during their renovation period TWO years ago to store miscellaneous/renovation/staff items, but ever since its reopening, they have not been unlocked for members to use, which poses a problem for members to store their items during peak periods. I have no idea what treasures lie beyond those locked doors, or if there is some unspoken evil trapped away during their renovation years back, that if unleashed, would wreck havoc upon the gym staff and members present at that moment in time.

Anytime Fitness ACE The Place CC,y. y,1,"am extremely disappointed with my experience at Anytime Fitness. I purchased 20 personal training sessions in December 2023, with the assurance they would never expire. However, when I tried to use them in June 2024, I was told my trainer was leaving and that my sessions had “lapsed.” Despite repeated requests for a new trainer, I received no follow-up, and my membership fees continued to be charged with no ability to use the services.

I also attempted to terminate my membership, but the branch refused to take action and kept delaying the process. The lack of professionalism and transparency is unacceptable. I strongly advise you to think twice before signing up with Anytime Fitness ACE the place branch due to their misleading practices and poor customer service.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness ACE The Place CC,S. Fatimatuzzahrah S. Abdullah A.Q,5,"I go between here and their gym at Marsiling CC only because the staffs here are respectful and approachable.

My favourite hour to go is in the early hours at about 7 AM where there's literally no one and you can use all of the equipment, uninterrupted.

Now while we're at it, I have to commend on the Coach Ismail's HIIT & Boxing classes held there every Friday. This is a class NOT TO BE MISSED. His class definitely make you break a sweat even for a newbie like myself and his years of experience really shines through. He is not only understanding and highly emphatic, he is also such an encouraging and motivating individual which is helpful for those who comes to his class as they varies from all different fitness level.

Anytime Fitness ACE The Place CC,HEI HEI,1,"I recently joined Ace the Place Gym and have had a very disappointing experience.

Last week, I was approached by a trainer who was initially very friendly and corrected my posture. He convinced me to sign a trial package that included three sessions. The first session went well, and the trainer asked me to sign up for another 10 sessions, which I did. We sat down and agreed on Monday and Tuesday at 10 AM for the lessons.

However, on Friday night, the trainer called and said I needed to pay extra for software to track my fitness routine, which I declined.

When Monday came, I arrived at the gym at 10 AM, but the trainer was nowhere to be found. After texting and calling, the trainer informed me that he had rescheduled my sessions to Tuesday and Wednesday without notifying me in advance.

Overall, this gym has been more focused on hard selling unnecessary products rather than providing a consistent and professional training experience. I have only attended one session of PT and paid $1000, which they declined to refund me despite the experience I faced. Oh well, I guess lesson learned here. You have been warned!

I hope they improve their customer service and communication.

Update: The assistant manager of Anytime fitness Ace the Place declined my refund request on 3rd July there was no alternate solution to how my remaining sessions can be ultised.

They said I have insufficient proof that I have made an appointment for Monday and Tuesday and the PT trainer said he had booked me for Tuesday and Wednesday but there was no evidence (no text, no email nothing) they just assume and thinks that you are free on that day without even communicating with their customers. Up to date I have attempted and requested to speak with their manager and today is 8 July I have never heard from them to resolve the matter.

Update update:
Up till today (22 July 2024) there is no answer from them. I’m forced to bring this matter to CASE to resolve it.

The trainer name is VEEN.
The assistant manager is Daniel Raj.

I’m looking forward to speak to their manager, but up till today it’s impossible to speak anyone. No calls, No Text, No emails.",Date not found

It's easily the best part of my day.

Zul has also gone the extra mile to help me relook my daily food intake and nutrition to enhance my performance at the gym.

What I like most is knowing that he's not someone who builds his muscles and calls it a day. Zul's dedication towards fitness and personal training lies in his knowledge of the field. I know that he is constantly learning and taking up related courses to do his job better and for the benefit of his clients such as myself.

It is never an easy task to consistently improve the space for everyone but they are dedicated to doing so. They must be given gratitude for their sincerity, loyalty and commitment.
