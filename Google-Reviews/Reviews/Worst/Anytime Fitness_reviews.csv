Anytime Fitness,Stormy,4,"Nice Simple CC.
Most of the facilities are mentioned by others.
They have basketball court, badminton court, dance studios, Macs, Starbucks, Subway.

The basketball court serves as a multipurpose hall too. Very airy which is good.

Nice cosy Starbucks place to be at, that is if there are no noisy peeps around to create noise pollution. This Starbucks has a nice foreign feel, does make you feel like you are not in Singapore. I love it. ☺ ❤",Date not found

Anytime Fitness,Ashikin Zulkifli,5,"Small outlet but surprisingly well equipped. At least 1 machine for every muscle group and free weights go up to 50?kg IIRC. 2 squat racks, 1 smith machine & 2 benches. At the time I’m posting this it’s right as their club refresh is starting. Can’t wait to see the new look.

No deadlift platform due to space constraint but a good sized functional area + equipment.

Convenient for me to get a workout in as it’s nearby home. Though I’m unsure of how bad the crowd gets on weekday evening as I prefer to frequent on weekend mornings (~7am) and it’ll be quite empty.

The staff are also all friendly and greet you with a smile as you come in. I really appreciated it when I was first starting my fitness journey and made me feel secure enough to sign membership here :)",Date not found

Air-conditioning broke down on the 28th July 2020 and up until now (7th August) it is not resolved. Again, with unjustified reason, they said the air-conditioning repairs is done by the facility management.
