Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Jack,3,"The location is not that accessible but space is rather adequate. Almost all the machines you need are here, but unfortunately the machines are too close together. The functional area is very spacious though and I thought space here could be better utilised. Some of the weights are rather old and mixed brands. The doorway to the toilet is a hazard right next to a rack with uneven steps but I guess regulars will probably not have an issue with this.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,10 meter Kuk,3,"I’ve been a regular member at this gym and have generally appreciated the convenient location and the friendly staff. However, I’d like to raise a concern that I hope management can address.

Several pieces of equipment, like the leg extension machine, have been out of order for over a month now, and unfortunately, there hasn’t been much visible progress in getting them repaired. This has started to impact the workout experience, especially during peak hours when available machines are in higher demand.

I understand that maintenance can sometimes take time, but I hope the team can prioritise the repairs soon or provide an update on the situation.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Sihan Goi,5,"One of the better Anytime Fitness gyms around. There are 2 power racks with attached platforms, another dedicated platform, another 2 half racks, plenty of bars and bumper plates to go around, including 1 Eleiko bar and 2 hex bars, lots of plate loaded and cable/pulley machines, an open area for warmups/battling ropes/sled work/heavy bags, and the usual cardio machines. There's also a lone C2 rower, which is nice to see since most other AF gyms seem to favour water rowers instead. Facilities wise, there's a unisex changing/shower room, but no toilets (you'll have to go out to the main building toilet for that. Crowd wise, I was there from about 730am to 9am. Initially it was quite empty, but past 8am it started getting crowded, and all the racks were used. Parking at the area is kinda confusing since there are so many different buildings in the area (the gym is at Helios), but ultimately they all share the same basement carpark, so just go inside and follow the signs to Helios.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,KQ Ng,1,"I was looking for a gym and there was a presale promotion booth for AF Rochester sitting outside AF Buona Vista. I go thru the details and contacted AF Rochester thru WhatsApp. I was told I could get a free month because I was referred by a friend. I signed up and went to AF Rochester, then only I realized that free month will only be given AFTER the 12 month contract. I wasn’t aware and wasn’t told about this at all. It is clearly a misleading marketing trick. Pls clarify for anyone signing up with AF.",Date not found
Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Darren Tan Wei Jie,5,"Nestled in the heart of Singapore's vibrant Buona Vista area, Anytime Fitness Buona Vista stands as a modern, well-equipped gym that delivers a high-quality workout experience around the clock. As part of the globally recognized Anytime Fitness franchise, this outlet offers 24/7 access to fitness enthusiasts of all levels, making it a top choice for professionals, students, and residents in the area.

Upon entering the gym, you're immediately greeted by a sleek, contemporary design that reflects both professionalism and comfort. The facility is exceptionally clean, spacious, and well-lit, featuring an open layout that allows for smooth navigation between different workout zones. A bright interior, complete with glass-panel walls and bold LED signage, provides an energizing atmosphere perfect for focused training.

One of the gym’s standout features is its diverse range of state-of-the-art equipment. The image shows a full set of Life Fitness machines designed for strength training, alongside free weights neatly racked against mirrored walls to allow for proper form checks. Whether you're looking to build muscle, burn fat, or tone up, there’s equipment tailored to every goal — from seated row and chest press machines to leg curl and extension setups.

Cardio enthusiasts are equally well catered to. A row of high-end treadmills lines the side of the gym, each with built-in screens and controls for customized workouts. Their positioning along the glass windows offers a nice outside view, which enhances the experience, especially during early mornings or late-night runs. The treadmills appear new and are neatly covered, signaling proper maintenance and care for hygiene — a hallmark of Anytime Fitness locations.

Another notable aspect is the gym’s clear attention to inclusivity and user guidance. Equipment is labeled clearly, with visual instructions and safety tips for beginners. This is especially helpful for first-time users who may need more confidence navigating gym machinery. There’s also evidence of functional training areas and possibly a space for personal training sessions or group classes — services that Anytime Fitness often includes in its membership packages.

Conveniently located near business hubs, residential areas, and the Buona Vista MRT station, this outlet is ideal for busy professionals who need flexibility. The 24-hour access allows members to work out on their own schedule, whether early in the morning, during a lunch break, or after a long day at work. Security and access control systems ensure safety, even during off-peak hours.

In addition to its facilities, members benefit from the Anytime Fitness app, which offers workout tracking, virtual training programs, and community support. For travelers or those frequently on the move, the universal membership grants access to thousands of Anytime Fitness gyms worldwide.

In summary, Anytime Fitness Buona Vista is more than just a neighborhood gym — it's a polished, user-friendly fitness hub that prioritizes accessibility, cleanliness, and performance. Whether you’re starting your fitness journey or a seasoned athlete, this branch offers a welcoming and fully equipped environment to help you achieve your goals, anytime.",Date not found

Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Jeremy Chan,5,"Went to this gym for the 1st time today because I had events in that area earlier. I went during the peak hour though, around 6pm & was there till about 9pm.

Did not take any pictures as I believe there are sufficient pictures of this gym now. The only thing that made me feel a little meh was how packed the gym was. But notwithstanding, it’s understandable since it was during peak hours. My favorite Anytine Fitness gym is the one at City Hall but even for that gym I never go during peak hours because the crowd gets super crazy, even worse than this gym during peak hour even though the City Hall gym is bigger.

Nevertheless, I still enjoyed my session at the gym today and I got to do everything I needed to do without waiting much. They have some pretty obscure equipment which is a thumbs up for sure. Hack squat machines they do have at other AF gyms albeit not many, but it was the 1st time I saw a belted squat machine at any AF gyms.

In summary, this was definitely a nice gym and even though I said the peak hour dampened my mood a little, I’m still giving it 5 stars as it deserves the rating I feel. On a side note, many many MANY years ago I was a member of Fitness First for many years and used to move around to the different FF gyms and the Metropolis FF gym was 1 of the gyms I frequented quite often. Passing it today though it looks sad & desolate. Hahahaha! I guess AF took a number of their customers away. Lol. Nice gym to go to if you’re in that area! I stay central/east so this isn’t exactly close to me, the City Hall AF is super close hence it being my favourite. But if I’m ever in the area I wouldn’t hesitate to go to this AF!",Date not found

I have been a long-time member of this gym, and it's disheartening to witness its decline in cleanliness and hygiene standards since the pandemic. The once exceptional facility has become a shadow of its former self.

The state of the shower-rooms is appalling. Despite numerous posters reminding gym members not to urinate in these areas, the lingering smell of urine persists. It's both unpleasant and completely contrary to a sanitary environment that one expects from a reputable gym.

The gym's poor air-flow circulation contributes to an overwhelming stench of sweat throughout the premises.

Being located at a convenient part of the city and being open 24/7 its a perfect fit for everyone’s busy schedules. With an ambient interior and equipped in abundance AFBV is capable of hosting the fitness journey of many.
Moving on to staff, the most prominent guy I noticed was Abbas, he is dedicated to the clients while being so friendly and approachable. He sets an example to us how he maintains his body and behaviors. Such a gentleman.
Kester and Farah Norena  three other amazing souls who wouldn’t hesitate to help u with any matter in the gym. They will individualize ur workout routine rather than giving u a routine set. And the meal prep advice and supplementation advices are on point and goes hand in hand with their program , through social media. And always wanted to have biceps like kester but it’s going far away 😅
Finally our doggy Jax will inspect whether u do ur work correctly and give u cuddles and hugs if u are good. He is such a good boi and gives the best emotional support. Don’t forget to pet him if u go to AFBV 😊

Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Benelma Burau-North,5,"I joined AF 6 months ago and the initial attraction was the flexibility you have to train anywhere and the range of equipment that is way and above my condo gym. I have been very impressed by the ethos and culture of the organisation as I have had a few challenges where I had to place membership on hold for medical reasons and there was no questions asked , just flexibility and an understanding that the company works around your needs and has waived fees etc. There is also not the presssure to commit to expensive PT like others gyms , you can take it or leave it and for example , just choose to have basic tracking such as the body composition analysis. I highly recommend this organisation to anyone wanting a quality and flexible experience for their gym membership.

Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Jared ooi,1,"The worst customer service in a gym sector. If Google allow me to give zero ratings, definitely I will give it.

The gym asked a debt collector to chase me for just a 2 months fail payment. THE MAIN CONCERN was AF send me a letter and asked me to settle this payment amount of $1255.48 which is TEN TIMES of the 2 months fail payment which cost only $176.48 within 7 days and I will be incurred any legal action if I fail to do so. I have clarified with the debt collector that AF claim I have no payment since I joined their membership since July 2022, means their system not able to capture my payment all the while.

Then, I called and WhatsApp to AF Buona Vista and even went down to the outlet. The services made me truly disappointed as they never apologise for the system mistake at first and also they direct offered me to cancel my membership the next, but I need to pay for the cancellation fee as my membership tier was under the minimum term. Here can see they never appreciated me as one of the member and don even care to let go the customer as I holding the lowest tier membership.

I have requested to meet the manager and see how to settle this issue, however the manager made me feel like  don”t have the sincerity as one of the male staff (who communicate with his manager at the same time on the phone) telling that his manager will be working til 6pm the next day but switched immediate to 430pm after I mentioned I will drop by around 530pm. It seems like fooling around us.

Also, this company also trying to take advantage on me as in like if I really no able to provide the proof of my payment transaction, then means I need to pay the amount that you charged on me ?!!

If anyone of you reading this review or you are one of the membership of AF, pls be alert and be reminded and make sure you have your clear payment record!! If not you will be the next victim.

Total lost trust to this fitness centre.",Date not found

Kester has been very patient and customises the diet plan according to my food preferences and  the exercises so PT sessions are not me doing the same old exercises all the time!

Anytime Fitness Buona Vista,Carol,5,"Abbas is wonderful! I can't say enough good things about him. We signed up for the PT session for a unique goal - to kickstart ""gyming"" and learn the correct form for different workouts. I really appreciate that Abbas catered his sessions to our needs and designed a program to work towards our goal, instead of fitting us to any set template. He really helped us achieve what we look for at the end of the 10 sessions and now we are officially onto our gyming journey!
During the sessions, Abbas is patient, encouraging, and thorough in his explanation. He would correct our forms and also explain the anatomy behind it to help us better understand. He always encourages questions and helped us solve all problems we face in different exercises.
He is also patient and never rush us during the training, going deep into each concept and give us multiple sets to make sure we learnt the technique thoroughly and do it right, sometimes even going beyond the scheduled duration just to teach us more.
He is also gentle and encouraging, which really helped us overcome the 'fear' of being a newbie to train in gyms. Now I am no longer afraid of going to gyms! He really motivates me to continue gyming and start living a healthier lifestyle.
All in all, I would (and will) definitely recommend anyone who needs PT to come to Abbas' class. It was a invaluable experience!",Date not found
