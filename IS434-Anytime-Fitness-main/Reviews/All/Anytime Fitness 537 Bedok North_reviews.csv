Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,Charmaine Ng,5,"I’ve been to several gyms in Singapore, both commercial and boutique, and my experience at Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North has truly stood out over the past year.

The staff are friendly, approachable, and always ready to help. The gym is clean, neat, and well-organized, with clear efforts to maintain a safe and comfortable environment. I appreciate how they actively remind members to wear proper footwear and re-rack weights to keep the space orderly, though of course, not everyone follows the rules all the time!

I’ve also been doing Personal Training with Steve, and his professionalism and dedication are remarkable. He’s meticulous about form and consistency, always tracking my progress and the weights I lift to ensure continual improvement. Unlike some trainers who just go through the motions, Steve genuinely cares about his clients’ progress and knows exactly how to help you push past your limits safely.

Overall, I highly recommend this gym,  and if you’re considering personal training, ask for Steve. You’ll be in good hands!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25CUmRHcGtPVFp6Uldwa2FUZEVMWE13WmpadmRVRRAB
Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,Michael Thein,5,"Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North is an excellent gym – spacious, clean, and never too crowded, so equipment is always available. The two big TV screens add a nice vibe to the training environment. Staff are super friendly and approachable, always ready to help with advice or a smile. Love the variety of free group classes like HIIT, Yoga, and Zumba. A great place to work out and feel motivated!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2kxV2RteHJUVEZCY21Wa056UmZja1UwYW1oSlgwRRAB
Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,Aly,1,"I started coming here because my partner lives nearby and had been considering making this my regular gym. Everything was great during my first few visits, but yesterday was the worst experience I’ve ever had in any gym and unfortunately, it’s made me reconsider coming back.

A staff member named Steve pointed out that I had placed some weight plates in the wrong spot. It was an honest mistake. I genuinely didn’t realize I had put those plates on the wrong rack. I have no problem being corrected, and I would’ve gladly fixed it, but the way it was handled was disappointing. Instead of quietly letting me know, he chose to point it out in front of everyone, which was unnecessary, embarrassing and left me feeling humiliated.

I completely understand and appreciate that staff need to maintain order and uphold gym standards, but there are ways to do that with tact and professionalism. A simple, respectful reminder in private would have been much more appropriate.

As someone who struggles with anxiety, being called out publicly like that was very distressing. I always make sure to clean equipment before and after use, re-rack my weights, and often tidy up after others as well. In fact, before using the incline press machine the same day, I cleared weights left behind by the previous person without complaint, something you can easily verify on your CCTV if needed. To be treated disrespectfully despite this effort was disheartening.

Steve is a senior coach, and with that title comes the responsibility to know how to approach people respectfully. While I appreciate that he eventually apologized (after my partner spoke with him), the damage was already done. A simple “sorry” doesn’t undo the embarrassment or the emotional impact of that moment. A public reprimand over a small, honest mistake is not the way to build a supportive community environment.

I genuinely hope this feedback leads to better communication and sensitivity toward members in the future, especially toward women who just want to feel comfortable and safe working out. For a gym that promotes community, this experience unfortunately showed the opposite.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xaNVkwZFdTMGhvWVhGVFNrSldaMTlpV0hKRGJVRRAB
Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,Tessa Peng,5,"Steve has been training me for a few months, and I would genuinely recommend him to anyone looking for a personal trainer. He’s always professional and full of positive energy, no matter how his day has been, even when he’s not feeling his best, he still shows up with a great attitude.

What I really appreciate is how attentive he is. He pays close attention to form and corrects it right away, which has made a big difference for me. I’ve also become much more confident using the equipment at the gym thanks to his guidance. Steve never forces anything I’m uncomfortable with and always tailors the workouts to fit what I need and what I can handle.

It’s honestly been such a pleasure training with him, and I always look forward to our sessions. I’m really grateful for all the support and motivation he gives!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT20xNmJYVmlha1o0UW1oWlpHeFZNMHBOYlhGVE9XYxAB
Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,lue teh,4,"I wouldn’t say this is a 5-star gym but my trainer Steve definitely a 5-stars trainer. He is paying attention to all my posture and movement while we are doing the session. He gives positive and tactical guidance to correct my posture because I have lower back issues. He even tries his best to understand my requirements as a Taekwon-Do athlete to help me to build better strength and power in performing. With his help, I got myself one gold, one silver and one bronze in my April 2025 Korea Championship.

The gym wise is not a big gym, it is small, but all the equipments are neatly arranged and in place. The gym condition is clean, aircon is cold enough (most importantly). However, it will be a plus point if the each cubicle in washroom has an alcohol sanitation dispenser to wipe the toilet seat before use, since the toilet is shared for both male and female.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOR0o0Nkstek5iQmFREAE
Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,Judy Tan,5,"I’m a new member and currently gym hopping. This is not my home gym but the moment I stepped in, there was a faint hint of essential oil. This must be the best smelling  gym in the entire world. Crowd was minimal at 10am. There is plenty of space for everyone to move around each other. Equipments are neat and clean. Will be helpful if there were more sanitation wipes. The paper towels tear easily and the sanitizer dispenser doesn’t dispense enough solution to properly clean the equipments after use. But this is no big deal because it’s so clean here already. I think I found my favourite gym

Anytime Fitness 537 Bedok North,Chloe Tan,5,"I had always been physically weak and was very hesitant to start going to the gym. Then I met Faz, and her kind words gave me the encouragement I needed to begin this journey.

From the very start, she has been patient and supportive—never rushing me, always cheering me on as I pushed through my limitations. She understands my hesitations and has been dedicated to guiding me at every step of progress.

Six months on, I can see real changes—not only in my body, but also in my mindset. I feel stronger, both physically and mentally. I’ve committed to another six months with Faz, knowing she will continue to help me become stronger and better.

Thank you, Faz, for your unwavering support. If you’re looking for a professional, patient, and results-driven trainer, I highly recommend Faz.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xaQlRrUTNiQzFDVVVkWWJqVjBObU5mTUZFNFlsRRAB

From back day to cardio days, it’s totally doable.

Plus, it’s just a short walk from my house, convenient enough that I really can’t make excuses! The vibe’s laid-back, staff are friendly and welcoming, and it’s easy to focus and get in the zone.

It’s been almost three months in and I’m already reaping the benefits in terms of my health and wellbeing - shout out to my Personal Trainer, Steve, for his guidance as well. Steve's deep knowledge of strength training and genuine commitment to my weight loss goals are evident. Each workout is tailored to my needs and abilities, challenging me without being overwhelming. I’ve learned thoroughly about correct postures and forms while training, as well as recommended nutrition to contribute to my weight loss journey. Apart from that, I’m more motivated to conduct self training at my convenience, thanks to the gym’s 24/7 access. The extensive range of new fitness equipment offered are a bonus too!
