Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Javier Alvira,5,"I recently switched from Virgin Active to Anytime Fitness (AF), and The Concourse location has really impressed me — especially considering I’m paying less than half now. While the space is compact, it’s spotless, well-equipped, and smartly laid out (doesn’t feel crowded, and there are windows all over), and it has everything from a squat rack and Smith machine to free weights, functional training machines, cardio gear and a spectacular new cables station which can accommodate up to 8 simultaneous trainers.

Beyond AF’s ultimate convenience proposition and this center’s effective arrangement, what has stood out most is the support from Hakim, the club manager. A few weeks into my training, after noticing I’d become a regular, he took the initiative to explain how to use the body composition monitor — something no one had ever walked me through before. He also personally helped resolve a billing issue I encountered during my membership transfer, handling it quickly and professionally.

By now, I’ve visited a few AF locations, and while this one is on the smaller side, it easily stands out for its cleanliness, thoughtful setup, and truly supportive management. A great example of how a smaller gym can still offer a high-quality experience.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2paU1R6RjZZVk5KWjFkVlpHZDVaRFJvTFZONmVXYxAB
Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,4,"The pros:
- Quiet, especially on weekends. Good alternative to Bugis bracing.
- For a small location, decent equipment - cable, dumbbells, pin-loaded machines, 1 squat rack, smith machine and good varieties of cardio machines.
- convenient location , near haji lane, Kampong glam,  Golden Mile tower.

The cons:
- small changing room, only 1 shower stall. For toilets, you have to use the buildings public toilet.
- Can get stuffy in certain areas of the gym (mostly fans).
- not suitable for powerlifters like me - only 1 squat rack and no deadlift platform.
- no hip trust machine

Overall, it's a good branch if you're working nearby, or not fussy.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xJNU5sQmtiRkJIWTFVMVpVNWhMUzEzVEhGVlMyYxAB
Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Adam Stephen,4,"Update May 2025: Got a new addition cable machine, thank you!!

On the positive side it's definitely a clean and well maintained gym.

Downside: After 10PM, no aircon. Only fan. It does get hot and humid 😭",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRdmR6aEF3EAE
Anytime Fitness The Concourse,I_Just_a Aiskajang,1,"Every time I come to this gym, there’s a strong smell of urine, and I never see the staff doing anything to address it.

Anytime Fitness The Concourse,David Hudson,2,"Probably one of the worst AF fitness I've been to in the world.

Aircon didn't work well, smelled, both male toilet cubicles ""out of order"", and very limited selection of equipment. Go to AF Bugis.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21KdVUxWnpiRUpLZFhwbVFWOU9ZbGR0WkRKR1ZVRRAB

Anytime Fitness The Concourse,Isaac Yeo,2,Fairly clean and quiet for exercising. Quite small compared to most other AF outlets. Biggest bummer is the lack of any cable machine whatsoever. It's quite a shocker for Anytime.,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBd2ZpZ3N3RRAB
