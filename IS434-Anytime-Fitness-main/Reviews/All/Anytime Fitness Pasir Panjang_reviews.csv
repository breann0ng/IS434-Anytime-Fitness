Their latest addition of offering free coffee is a hit. As a regular gym patron. We totally appreciate it especially after heavy workout and we need that additional caffeine just to walk through the exit door. Keep it up",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21OWlpWUk9MV3B0TFVFNWEwbERNV1IwTURSMldXYxAB

He will connect with the members to ask their views to improve the experience.  He also sorts out the plates and machines whenever he can.

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Sihan Goi,4,"Large and spacious, with separate spaces for free weights/plate loaded machines, other weight machines/cardio equipment, and a large room for group classes. The shower area is one of the better ones for AF too. Also, I like the fact that upgrades have been made over the years. Currently, there are 4 power racks, 2 back to back half racks, 2 lifting platforms, multiple adjustable benches, weight plates/bumper plates, multiple Olympic barbells (Ziva and Hammer Strength ones that spin, and a few old ones), hex bars, EZ bars, and heavier dumbells up to 47.5kg. Many of these are quite new. There's also a C2 rower, water rower, assault bike, and many spin bikes. I can't list all the equipment, just look at my pictures. There were a few things previously preventing it from getting 5 stars IMHO, but they've all been addressed one by one over the years, so it gets 5 stars from me now. The only bad things I can think of is the fact that you need to be relatively quiet while lifting. I've gotten complained before a couple years ago while setting the barbell down a bit too loudly, but bumper plates and platforms would kinda address this. Also, some of the staff aren't very familiar with the equipment when I had some questions. Other than that, it's awesome!

Update: I had to drop this to 4 stars, because despite the platform, bumper plates, and new hammer strength Olympic spin bars, you apparently can't do Olympic weightlifting here. I got complained by staff for dumping the bar from overhead, despite all the equipment being designed specifically to be dumped from overhead, because it was ""too loud"". There's no point getting the best equipment in the world if you can't use them the way they were designed to be used.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtMFoyZkVREAE

For starters, this AF is massive, and that means plenty of weights, machines, cardio and workout areas. This means that you no longer have to keep hovering around power racks waiting for the next guy to finish his sets.

General upkeep of the place is good, with minor wear as expected of any commercial gym. Locker and restroom facilities are basic but good (can't expect Pure Fitness facilities, and that's not what most gym goers are looking for).

Accessibility is excellent, about a 5 minute walk from Pasir Panjang MRT.

Moreover, many corporate gyms close early on weekends or closed on public holidays and it becomes very inconvenient to get a proper workout.

My main goal was to lose belly fat and improve general fitness, and I’m thrilled with the results. Thanks to Shahrizan, my personal trainer, I lost 5.5kg during the training period (mid July- mid Nov 2024) and achieved a transformative change in how I feel. Shah assessed my fitness level thoroughly and designed a customized program tailored to my needs. He also guided me with a sustainable diet routine, ensuring the journey was effective and manageable.

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Julian Ang,3,"Editing my review yet again.

Giving credit where it's due. JJ the sr mgr called me after the latest review i gave below. As well as to follow on my request to cancel my anytime fitness membership. He did an excellent job listening and accepting my perspectives whilst maintaining his professionalism on club management policies. Just for that, I'm bumping this place back to 3 stars. Unfortunately, it's too late for me, and I'm not prepared to reconsider my cancelling my membership.
---
The latest iteration of an operations team has frankly taken anal retentive-ness to a whole new level. Instead of actually calling out behaviour that inconveniences clients' use of facilities they call out behaviour and enforce rules that impinge on the EGOs and ultimately selfish dignity of complaining whiners. Extremely hypocritical and terrible leadership. You choose to assuage the egos of whiners over the actual functionality of a gym. Snail trails, coffee cups in corners, syringes in the stalls are ok but someone rolling out his lats with his shirt off, in a corner of the studio away from the main gym floor, coz the shirt gets rolled up as well, is oh-so-wrong. Please get your priorities straight.

The equipment here is fantastic and the gym space too, but you'd think the place is run by staff who simply don't pay attention.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbnZ1dGxnRRAB

I feel so comfortable and carefree in this gym as the size of this gym is about 5 or 6 times bigger than most gyms. To top if off, they offer group classes like LesMills BodyPump and BodyCombat which is very motivating to keep one's fitness on track. Additionally, they have super clean and abundant shower rooms with Rainshower amenities which makes showering after workouts a luxurious experience. The gym manager, i think his name is William, is very attentive and dedicated to helping the gym members.

Oh and the reviews? All those 5 stars? The gym will pester you and WhatsApp you to get you to give them 5 stars. For that, I'm removing another star to 2.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNteDZHcF93RRAB

When I walked in on my first session, I was greeted by the friendly William who recognised I was new to this particular club. He offered by a guided tour of all the facilities to put me at ease and know where everything is.

The facilities are plentiful and spacious. There are three distinct areas to the gym; a cardio machine section, a padded class studio, and an expansive free weights room. The weights room has four squat racks, and plenty of weights to go around, as well as two rowing machines and two air bikes if you're looking to throw some cardio into your weights routine. The padded class studio is a great place to go and work on your core or do some stretches in a quiet environment (when there's no classes happening).

The gym is located just a short walk down from Pasir Panjang MRT station on the Circle Line.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNta1pDQWVBEAE

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Eugene K,5,"I must say, this gym is not just spacious, but also well-equipped with a vast studio, a free weights area, and a machine area. You can find 6 squat racks, 2 cable machines, and 1 smith machine, which are all in excellent condition.

While the gym sees a manageable crowd during the morning and lunchtime, it can get a bit crowded during dinner time and night. However, it doesn't really affect the overall gym experience.

One thing that really stood out for me is the Evolt body analyzer, which has been immensely helpful in evaluating my body composition. It enables me and my physical trainer to keep a check on my body fat and muscle composition, leading to progress monitoring.

Speaking of my physical trainer, Risham, I must say he is exceptional. With his vast experience, he has been able to guide me in proper movements for both free weights and machines. Besides, I have learned many useful stretching techniques from him, which have helped me improve my flexibility.

What's more impressive is that Risham has also taught me additional exercise techniques such as sport massage and suspension training. He focuses on compound movements that stress multiple muscle groups and has helped me cover the whole body effectively.

In short, if you are looking for a gym with excellent equipment and an experienced physical trainer like Risham, this is the place to be.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSMGRxQ1VBEAE

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Winston Jun,5,"What can i say, Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang has everything that you want in a local gym. First off, the equipment are well mantained and clean and in these times of Covid, you see disinfectant sprays and wipes at almost every machine! No joke, its like every corner you turn, you would see 2 or 3 bottles. On top of that the space and equipment available is in ABUNDANCE i tell you, and to add on to that, they recently added even more equipement! You would find everything you need here.
The toilets, so clean and well mantained! They have a white colour scheme that is in no danger of getting stained or dirty despite it being a gym. This is thier commitment to hygiene and cleanliness. You have adequate number of shower rooms and changing rooms. They even have an aircon inside the toilet to keep you cool after your hot shower!

But the greatest thing for me, is the friendliness and warmth of the staff. They greet you so warmly like family at the door. So much so that if you walked in drenched from the rain, their hospitatlity would keep you warm. But please be advised to change out of your wet clothes. Among all the Anytime Fitness outlets i have been to, this one give me the most welcoming experience. There was once their club manger , William changed the weights for me on the bench press as he was worried that i was using different kind of weight plates, what a guy!

All in all, if you are looking for a place to start off your fitness journey, look no futher than Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang! You won't regret it.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHcjlUUWt3RRAB

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Leo Mrc,1,"Anytime Fitness had the brilliant idea of creating a scheme to charge extra money to customers in a legal way. The gym chain has appointed a third party to collect the monthly fee and when the partner does not carry on the transaction they charge 14 dollars to customers.

Aggressive behavior to customers just to make extra revenue is completely uncorrelated to my personal values.
Please reading this review just realize the bad faith of the gym trying JUST ONE TIME to take your monthly fee and IMMEDITATELY CHARGING 14 dollars for not succeeding.

Anytime Fitness Pasir Panjang,Janie S.B Tan,5,"Everyone would have read about how big and spacious and new the gym is so I wouldn't repeat the same comments again. I would like to comment on the customer service aspect of it and I must say as of now, I'm blown away by it, be it the instructors or administrators.

I used to be a gym member for many years before California fitness closed down. After ten years of not being in the gym, signing up for one somehow felt a bit scary for me, but from sign-up to registering for classes to attending classes, it has been a really pleasant experience for me. Sign-up was easy and relaxing because the staff was really friendly (Alex and William); Class registration is really quick using the app and the instructors, though having to teach very very small classes because afterall this is a new gym, are very friendly, full of energy and enthusiastic nonetheless.

When the COVID hit, I was worried about my gym membership because the gym is close to my workplace but very far from my home, but the team reacted very fast and William the club manager suspended my membership. I am very grateful and surprised by their understanding because in my former gym, when I had to be overseas for a few months and I asked for a suspension, it was a real struggle to get it approved.

And during this COVID period, I get messages from the gym sometimes on various things like free online workout classes by their instructors, free temporary access to Les milles classes, or just simply a hi and check on my well-being.

And though it is not directly affecting me per se, I love the fact that they are still paying their staff even though I know most gyms have asked their staff to go on unpaid leave due to the COVID situation. I always believe that happy employees means happy customers. I really have to give them my thumbs and toes up for this.

Their passion to provide world class service and utmost care for their gym members and staff really makes me proud to be part of the AF Pasir Panjang family.

Good job AF PP.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjaE1mLVVBEAE
