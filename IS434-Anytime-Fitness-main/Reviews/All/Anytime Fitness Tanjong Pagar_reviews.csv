Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,jiayi,5,"I attended the HIIT class session with Indra at AF International Plaza and had such a great experience! The workout was well-structured, energetic, and challenging in the best way. The trainer was very motivating and made sure everyone was engaged, while also providing modifications for different fitness levels.

The atmosphere was positive and welcoming, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. It’s a great spot to push yourself, burn calories, and leave feeling accomplished. I’ll definitely be coming back for more sessions!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tSNldUWlViVUZPUjAxTFgwVnFPVVJFVFhkWmIzYxAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Ally Ong,5,"I’ve been visiting this gym for a while now, and it’s easily become my happy place. The staff are warm and welcoming, the space is spotless, and the layout is well organized, weights are always perfectly reracked like some behind-the-scenes magic is happening. The equipment is well-maintained it’s spoiled me for other gyms.

Being right in the heart of the CBD, it does get busy during peak hours - think “after-work drinks” level of packed. If that’s not your scene, just tweak your workout time and you’ll have a much smoother experience. The gym is in an older building, which makes its location perfect but also means a little consideration goes a long way: don’t slam the weights (nobody needs a surprise earthquake drill), and be ready to share machines when it’s busy.

I train with Mansor, and honestly, it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. He really knows his stuff and has a sharp eye for safety. Mansor has this rare mix of pushing you to your limits while keeping you grounded, so you’re not just building a Greek god physique, but also the mental toughness to take on the world (or at least your corporate inbox). He might look a little intimidating at first because he enforces the rules (rerack your weights, don’t slam, don’t do anything dangerous), but really, he’s one of the friendliest people you’ll meet as long as you’re not the person trying to turn the gym into a demolition site.

And if you’re curious, check out the PT packages. They’re not just for lifting, you can use them for stretching sessions, or even kickboxing if you need to release some steam after a rough day at the office.

All in all, this gym is a gem. Show up, be respectful, rerack your weights, and don’t be that person, don’t hog machine. If everyone does their part, we’ll all keep enjoying this convenient, vibrant spot in the CBD, a place where you can laugh, sweat, and recharge, together.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2psNWFrcG5TVVZsUVRsNVlXSlFjME50ZVhSeFZGRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Ken Jack,1,"The gym itself is fine, but the personal trainers tend to have a very bad attitude, especially the one with glasses. I have had an extremely unpleasant experience with the same guy two times already. He has been acting like he owns the place and taken over a machine I was using. The way he talked to me was so aggressive that I felt uncomfortable being around. I hope in some way they will have the trainer learn how to speak with the gym users in nicer ways (he seems to be a nice guy towards his “customers”) but if the situation persists, I guess I will have to report it to the HQ of Anytime Fitness.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GQ1ZXUXRNazFCWmtoTGVXeHlkMlpaWjNkM1FuYxAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Jackson Greenwood,1,"Hands down the worst gym ever. I decided to give this gym a try as my current gym was renovating. From the moment I step inside the gym, I started getting sized up by the male trainers, they were predominantly of the malay ethnicity. My colleagues that uses this gym sometimes also said the trainers are quite unprofessional and always chat up their lady friends should they join them in the gym. The gym have a smell of undried towels near the free weights area too. Would give 0 stars if possible. Worst gym In the world!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2sxbGVWRjZTbVZEUW1kbmMxVmpkelJ4YlVwb2FrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Hannah Teo,5,"Hands down - my favorite AF outlet ever. The spacing of the equipment is great, as the gym does not try to pack a bunch of equipment into a tight space. But more importantly, vibes are good here - largely in part to the trainers, who are the friendliest folks you'd ever meet!

I recently had a morning workout here - and three of them noticed that I was displaying symptoms of low blood sugar. So they approached to check up on me, gave me some dates from their own pockets, and gave me tips on what I can do the next time this happens.

Beyond this incident, they're always all smiles - and also very willing to help you with your form etc., even if they aren't attached to you as your personal trainer.

So happy to have found this gym :)",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xJeWVucHNUM290WTJGblIxSnViMTkxZFdGaU0xRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Regina T,5,"This is honestly one of my favourite AF outlets! It’s conveniently located, well equipped yet spacious, and very well maintained too.

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Ryan Wong,5,"There are many good gyms across Singapore, but to find a great gym is always a bonus. Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar (located within International Plaza) is an example of a great gym: the spacing between equipment is good, the equipment are all generally well-maintained, the staff and fellow gym goers are polite to each other, and I think manager Azri with his team of Personal Trainers do a good job in creating a positive and inclusive environment where members and first timers feel comfortable and safe training at their own pace.

I personally train with Muhammad and he does a phenomenal job of not just training you physically, but he also takes the time and effort to check on your personal wellbeing as well, such as how your food intake is going, and how your stress levels are. There are many good Personal Trainers out there, but a great one like Muhammad is always hard to find.

5 stars for Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar, and definitely 5 stars for PT Muhammad!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25GVE5sY3dZMVJoV0ZaZldYaExaMnhtYkVoSVJYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Tan Jun Kang,5,"Anytime Fitness International Plaza is an excellent gym that is always clean, well maintained, and welcoming. The environment feels friendly and motivating — trainers and members alike treat each other more like friends than strangers.
I have been training with Mansor, and the experience has been transformative. He has helped me improve my physical fitness significantly, and I’ve also observed the impressive results he has achieved with his other clients. His approach is both professional and encouraging, making every session effective and enjoyable.
Highly recommended for anyone looking for a supportive and well-kept gym in the CBD!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t4ak16UndTSHBuYkVvMFFUVmtkMkpoWTJwaGFVRRAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Terry Samuels,1,"A gym with a very “California Fitness” vibe. The instructors seem more interested in engaging with the ladies than providing professional guidance. While sitting near a machine, I overheard an instructor mocking another member to his client — ironically, the person he was mocking was lifting impressively and doing a workout the instructor himself probably couldn’t manage. Not the kind of Anytime Fitness I’d return to, especially when instructors are busy sizing up guys and acting cheeky only with the girls. Don’t do it so obviously, or at least don’t make comments that could be heard by members.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pKeVV6STJNMWxQU0ZGdlJFOTFNa2RxV1d4ekxVRRAB

This gym is fully equipped, clean and very professional.
The coach is very professional, with rich courses, suitable for people with different fitness needs.
The equipment is novel, well maintained, and the exercise experience is great.
The service attitude is very good, the atmosphere is positive, and it is very motivated to exercise here.
High cost performance, is an ideal place for fitness enthusiasts.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VQMjZqNTY0MFpYaHl3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Daniel Ng,5,"Located within International Plaza. Do have a look at their IG on directions to get there because it's in a relatively obscure corner.

Pretty basic AF here with the basics. Dumbbells are hammer strength which go up in increments of 2kg. Otherwise, the gym is maintained well and equipments are all working well.

Toilets are also really nice and clean with 5 showers in the male toilet and plenty of room to put your belongings.

Overall the gym is well laid out and spacious. A good gym for gen pop and recreational lifters who work in the CBD. Not the best for serious lifters because you won't have a ton of leg equipment.

UPDATE 14/3:
The gym has expanded and added a few more power racks as well as lifting platforms, feels even more spacious now!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNONjZ6eVR3EAE

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Random Random,1,"Even though AF claims you can use your access worldwide, this gym does not allow you to do so.

I was visiting Singapore for business travel, and wanted to use the gym. But I couldn’t tap in with my keyfob for some reason, there’s no AF personnel either.

I think AF should look into their policy again — this clearly a violation of member benefit if their selling point is worldwide access.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xwU1YyaHFhelZLYWxSdGJ6Rm9WV0pLUm04NFNWRRAB

The gym is very well equipped to perform plenty of workouts with new & well maintained equipments and machines. Not to mention, the staff here are very friendly and welcoming, you wouldn’t feel intimidated at all being here. Had a word with one of the staff and could definitely see that they’re trying to build a great culture within the gym.

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Xeno Xidal,1,"too crowded at busy hours, always have to wait for each machine. good luck doing supersets of any kind. Much rather prefer the outlet at Buona for peak hour.

Buona doesn't have overbearing ""coaches"" as well. Some of these coaches in TP outlet like to chat with the members, which distract them and make the waiting time for machines even longer. And if they got no one to chat, feels like you're being watched all the time, not comfortable, especially one of them who is not friendly at all. In Buona you get to do ur exercises in peace with nobody watching over you",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2w4emFqSnZOMnR3ZG5ZM1Zqa3hXVVJ0VERkRlgzYxAB

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Yati Saat,5,"Testimonial:

Here’s the start to my fitness journey.
Been going to Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar since January and I must say, I do enjoy it.

As a beginner, I engaged Muhammad as my personal trainer. 💪
Training with Muhammad have always been pushing my strength and understanding my weakness.
I feel comfortable knowing that he’s there to guide me and slowly build up the intensity of each workout 🏋️‍♀️. It’s structured but gruelling.
With his expertise & knowledge, you will definitely achieve your expected goals.🏆

I was 85kg before signed up with AFTGP. I’ve lost 12kg in 3 months!
I’m 73kg now! A big achievement so far. 🏆

I purchased a one-month membership in September and found it very convenient to exercise here for a month. Then, I went back to Korea for three weeks and came back to Singapore a few days ago. And I re-registered here. The reason I chose this place again is the staff is very nice to me especiallly Rainey and Muhammad.😄 actually I’m not good at speaking English bit they helped me to use gym more comfortably.

- Firstly toilets,shower and changing rooms are well integrated into the gym and have decent amount of space.
- Although it's in the heart of Singapore they don't comprise on space or equipment so it doesn't feel like your constantly squeezing around the gym.
- Plenty of benches and dumbbells which are usually the most used equipment so it's unlikely you will have to wait to use them.
- Extremely friendly staff
- Clean gym and availability of wipes to clean ur equipment
- Extra accessories in the gym available like many different cable accessories, weight belt and foam rollers( Only missing the double rope which city hall has)

Downside: cleaner cleans the toilet during timings when there's a huge crowd, causing congestion. Especially since there're only 2 cubicles😅 (the cleaner is friendly and does an excellent job, just wrong timingXD)",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1ekw3SFBREAE

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,hafiz jumahat,5,"Big and spacious. The only Anytime Fitness that has male/female shower room while the rest are unisex. Staffs are friendly.

No weightlifting platform so not an ideal place for powerlifters to train as you're not suppose to drop weights there. It's also a good thing so that the gym is not crowded with lifters hogging equipments for more than an hour.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCeDhTRmFnEAE
Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Annie Yuan,3,"edit: it looks like the AC issue wasn’t fixed after all (and continues to get worse, as this gym is now busier and the number of people packed into the space with only a handful of functioning fans makes it nearly impossible to breathe much less exercise). dropping another star until they get some proper ventilation going. i also echo another reviewer’s sentiment about the music - it’s unbearably loud after hours. shame because this is a beautiful, well-equipped gym.

my only gripe with this gym before the recent renovation was the lack of AC. now post-expansion they’ve not only added a functioning AC, they’ve also added two brand new deadlifting platforms and four squat racks. easily my favourite anytime fitness location in singapore now - will likely switch my default over from bugis to this one.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5ak4tZ1pnEAE

Hello, I’m already re-racking, why you coming up to me like I’m not racking?

After sometime while using other machines, I glanced back and noticed the squat rack had a 3plate load each side with no person on it. Why never enforce other people to rack back weights? Favouritism much?

This is a lifters gym (which I enjoy). It doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles and isn't the best for classes or the like except strength training and some HIIT; although they are starting to bring in some interesting equipment and they do hold group classes often. They also have excellent personal trainers if your pocket is deep enough...

The new trainers now greet me whenever I see them and it really brings a smile to my workout.
Heard from the grapevine more to come in terms of equipment, I am eagerly looking forward to it.

Forcing me to put back weights that are already on the machines even before i came in. Horrible attitude. Told me he checked cctv that i last used the machine n insist i put them back. Come on bro, having big muscles doesn't mean ppl need to be afraid of u.. wake up and learn to treat customers politely. You are paid because of our membership fee, hope u will learn from your mistake.

In the past three months this outlet has had a complete overhaul of the entire gym  with new facilities, all brand new equipment, and new staff. The atmosphere is friendly, clean, engaging, and conducive for a top quality workout. The staff is super helpful providing you assistance at the drop of a hat. If you're looking for a trainer look no further. Anytime Fitness has some of the most knowledgeable and caring trainers you can find (I recommend Mansor). They're focused on you the entire time you train helping you to achieve your goal. They also use data driven metrics (body composition analyser machine) to analyse your progress and differentiate your workout to your individual needs. The gym offers plenty of space so it never feels crowded and it runs 24/7 so you can find a time that works for you. Finally, this is a gym that welcomes all types of people form beginners to experienced gym rats, from young to old, guys and girls.

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,こばやし レオ,2,"The gym is ok.
But they have some of the worst gym bullies there. One of them asked to share the equipment (for chest workout) but in an unfriendly tone, while he was doing back, which was fine. So I let him use, and when it's my turn again, it was my last set and after I did a few reps, I wanted to drop the weight and continue to do a few more reps but he wouldn't let me. He said it's his turn. Omg. Then after he finished that set, he came to me and asked ""what's your name? what's your problem?"" Omgggg
Then another day I encountered another guy. He just ""growls"" a lot when he's working out, very loudly that the whole gym can hear him. And he puts the bar on the metal racks very loudly too. And when he's using other equipments, he also lets go at the highest point such that the metals just clash super loudly. It's like he wanna break the equipments. When he asked to share the dumbbell or equipment, he would say something like ""can I share this since you are looking at your phone?"" Helloooo, everyone needs to rest between set. Looking at handphone to reply messages for 30seconds is normal. And rest between sets can last for 1 to 2 minutes also. Why can't I look at handphones? You can ask to share and I don't mind sharing. But the attitude is bad.

And the water flow from the sinks at the basin and water dispenser is extremely slowww.
Also, the cleaner likes to vacuum and mop behind u and the vacuum and mop would just hit ur feet. And u can tell it's intentional coz he can totally see u standing there and it happens many times. I don't understand why he could not just say ""excuse me"" or just simply not mop so close. The fact that it looks intentional is really irritating.
And the cleaning of toilet and changing room always happens during 6-7pm where it's usually when most people come to gym and get changed...

Starting next week I think I will purposely take a bus to the next nearest AF branch to work out (this branch is just opposite my office and is super convenient for me but I'd rather travel to gym).",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPNVlPM1RnEAE

Asked around and some of my friends have encountered the same problem with her too.
Maybe then they should remove the notice on their notice board that says “find a training partner” then.

I joined most expensive gym ( $259 per month) and cheapest gym which is Dennis gym ( 6 month $200+ ) in singapore . And also California gym , virgin active , gymmboxx and etc many of them . I like to training in different place . It’s give me a lot of motivation .  I think I had “ the right condition “  to tell  you all of “ my opinion “ for choosing gym for rate  0-100 .
The atmosphere is good . AC is cool enough . Good location . This is the only reason I come here often after I moved to the city area . Gym located level 3 . Please note that a lot of office or shop below the level , so they probably
show you their phone because they get complaints / feedback from their neighbors. Obviously ,
Soundproof is poor . If you training heavy and hard you should no go there . They will judge you from start till you end . And then u must remember / guess  where’s those weight come from . They will judge you like they judge me . stared at me from top to bottom like I’m a guilty person because I don’t place the weights to the correct place . but guess what ? That’s those place I took from .  It feel uncomfortable . It’s ok if they have their rules I’m able to follow up to keep it a safety place for everyone . For the guy who does placing weights to the “
Right place “ he show his aggressive attitude to me . Feeling like he doing this,  it’s “ FOR ME “ ?
But guess again , coaches and member by coaching was ok to do no re-rack the weights , laughing louder .
I’m probably stay back from this 2 of my “ personal view “

Anytime Fitness Tanjong Pagar,Peter Lee,1,"one of the two gym managers (the chubby one) is outlandishly rude, and quite ignorant towards members' requests for assistance. couple weeks ago, tried to seek help from her as i had left my shoes in the changing room. despite dialling the office (a cellphone number, no less) 6-7 during office hours, not a single one was answered. sought the help of a trainer at another AF brancher closer to home. he sent an email, but no response to that either. just now, i walked into the gym without tapping my key, as the door was already wide open. relatively new member, so did not know i had to tap at all times. then this lady follows me to the men's changing room and tells me to come out to tap the key, ""while i am god damn changing"". at any other gym or workplace, this would be considered sexual harrassment. but i guess this is the accepted normal at AF Tanjong Pagar.

* update march 2018, just saw the above mentioned staff enter the male changing room AGAIN. Despite having male staff around to help out with whatever it is that she was attempting to achieve. Guess this is the accepted norm here, given that its continued for so long. Or maybe the gym management simply doesnt give two cents about common etiquette.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNRb195M3pnRRAB
