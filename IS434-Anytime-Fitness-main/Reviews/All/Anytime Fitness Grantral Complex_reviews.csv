Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,arjun sharma,5,"Anytime Fitness Taiseng is one of the best gyms in the area! The facility is always clean, well-maintained, and equipped with everything you need,from free weights and machines to functional training gear. The staff are friendly, approachable, and genuinely care about members’ progress. It’s never overcrowded, and the environment feels motivating and welcoming. Perfect place for both beginners and serious lifters. Highly recommended!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tGS2JFbzRNREptVFVSdU1FZGxkSEZSV0V0VVVWRRAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Wyne Honey,5,"Anytime Fitness at Grantral Mall is super convenient with 24/7 access and a good range of equipment. Staff are friendly and the location’s easy to get to. Downsides: it gets crowded during peak hours and maintenance/cleanliness could be better.

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,A Josh Lin,5,"I frequent Grantral Complex regularly as it's conveniently located just below my workplace at Grantral Mall, MacPherson. The staff here are consistently courteous and helpful—special thanks to Club Manager Shaffiee, who has always been accommodating to my needs and queries.

That said, my main concern lies with the gym's limited equipment and the condition of some of the machines. Several bench covers are visibly worn out, and during peak hours (especially weekdays from 6–8pm), the gym becomes overcrowded. It's often difficult to get a turn on the machines, with some having to be shared among multiple users at once—highlighting the shortage of key equipment.

Particularly lacking are machines such as the Smith machine, shoulder side lateral raise, pin-loaded bicep curl, and dip stations for lower chest/triceps. Additionally, there’s a lack of mirrors in some areas, which are essential for form checks and training.

I hope the management considers refurbishing the existing equipment and adding more machines. It would greatly improve the gym experience for all members.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2toNVpXcG5VbmxXUXpaUFdXdDNRblkwZFUxc2QwRRAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Aspiring Lawnmower,2,"I don't usually leave negative reviews, but this gym is a huge letdown. While the staff are friendly, the maintenance is lacking, especially in the toilets and changing rooms. They're consistently dirty, humid, and smelly, with floors that are always soaking wet. The changing room walls are literally black with dirt, the floor always has rubbish, and you have to wonder if the benches ever get wiped down.

The gym floor is also way too small and under-equipped for the number of people. You'll spend more time waiting for machines than actually working out.

I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere, there are better AF outlets in the area.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tsbVFWUlJWSGR3U0dzMGEwUlpWRzQzU0U5dGJFRRAB

The gym is always clean, and I appreciate how spacious and well-ventilated it feels even during peak hours. The staff are super friendly, professional, and always ready to help or answer questions. I’ve also seen real progress in my fitness since joining, which says a lot about the supportive environment.

Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a solid, welcoming gym to stay consistent with your goals!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOcVRwN2p6dE5hanhnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Carry Craze,1,"I’ve been a member of this gym for a few months. I went back to Malaysia 2 months ago and requested to transfer my membership to my home gym.

It’s been 2 months, and I’ve followed up, but the staff hasn’t replied to my WhatsApp messages.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25ScWFHRkZSMWR4UWkxcU9IWk9hVlZrYkVzeFUzYxAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,ntacx,2,"Unacceptable hygiene standards at this outlet

I understand that Anytime Fitness is a budget gym, but the cleanliness at this location is far below even basic expectations.
• The toilets are frequently flooded, dirty, and poorly maintained.
• The drains are often clogged, and there’s a persistent bad smell.
• Floors throughout the restroom and shower areas are consistently unclean.
• The showers themselves are in poor condition and unpleasant to use.
• Changing Room 1 has only one bench, and Changing Room 2 has none at all—this makes it inconvenient for members trying to change comfortably.

Post-workout showers should be a chance to cool down and feel refreshed, but the state of these facilities makes that impossible.

Also, good luck completing a workout on a weekday. Totally insufficient space and equipment for the number of members.

However, the staff are friendly and approachable. Reminded them on the state of the hygiene in the toilets once, and it did improve for awhile, but it’s back to being bad again.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOVy16TERBaV9YT3BBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Mark Lim,3,"This gym pretty much fits all my needs. It's a pretty good gym, I'd expect a bit more for the price but it isn't the worst, and still good value for money. 3 things though:

The AC could be better. It's pretty warm when I go in the mornings. Cardio area is also directly under the sun's glare in the mornings.

The leg press has pretty much 0 depth, can't do full ROMs on it.

The issue that gave this 2 stars though is the middle aged couple that other reviews have pointed out are still at it. It is something to consider when choosing this gym. The middle-aged lady in skimpy, almost see-through clothing, the creepy guy taking her videos, zooming in and out of various body parts, with the flash on most times.

I highly advise the staff of this gym to please look into this. I can't recommend this gym at all if this isn't addressed.

Edit 3rd July: haven't seen the couple in 2 weeks now. Raising my review to 3 stars, I'll check back in in a month.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pWMFF6ZDBibnBZUVRKcU9WTmxkRFYxUjNCWU1sRRAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Mochix Z,1,"Big gym but does not utilise the space fully. Lack of equipment during peak hour. Only one lat pull down cable machine compared to other AFs, its almost impossible to use them at times and have to queue for it.
Lack of benches at free weights area too.
Could be due to large influx of people here but this gym smells really bad compared to other AFs, the equipment are equally as smelly and repulsive. Was using the ropes to do face pulls but the smell was insanely bad with sweat/rotten fish that I gave up on my workout.
During peak hour its worst as the body odour just emits throughout the entire gym, leaving some members to spray their cheap cologne which is equally as intoxicating.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2poT1MwaHFOM0ZFYld0d1owa3pVRWxvWW5BMUxXYxAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,D.,1,"Lack benches, lack machines. Pretty common to see people working out in crocs despite it being banned. No wet wipes or cloth to wipe down as well. Then, you got people putting weights all over the place. Bathroom and changing room smells like it’s been abandoned for years. The stench travels all the way out to the changing room entrance.

Also, so much space but your staff deliberately tells people to move just to start his class which only has 2 people. What’s even more funny, after me and my friend moved off, the space isn’t even used. That space (which he was so insistent about) stayed empty until his goofing class ended where he and his students sat around talking and yapping.

We pay the same membership fees but why do we have to move just to accommodate your commercial activities that doesn’t benefit us?",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xFd1oySTRSbkZGVkhGeWRqa3pjbEJNYjNwQlZsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Jo,1,"AF Grantral is one if not the biggest AF gym I’ve been to, and the size can even be compared to its Malaysia counterparts. While being extremely spacious, the equipment count is a joke. Only 1 flat bench, and 2 incline benches. Seriously? Even hotel gyms have more benches. No T-Bar Row, no rear delts machine, and no plate-loaded machines at all.

I was training at the CORNER of the matted area. Your staff/trainer then taps me mid-set of my workout, and asks me to get lost as his class is starting. No basic courtesy of letting someone finish a set, and no respect given. Also, signs with “Please be in proper attire. No crocs/slippers” pasted all around, but you constantly see people training in crocs. Wow but in this scenario, all your staff members decides to turn a blind eye.

Sadly, a gym with massive potential that is on a downward spiral.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21GTk5XbHpRWGMxUVU5R2QxbHJObVZsT0RaR1drRRAB

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Xyriz,5,"Bright (maybe a lil too bright at the cardio area 😁) and spacious AF that is conveniently located near my place. Equipment is decent although I still found the cracked step up mentioned by an existing review which I agree is a big hazard. I went for the trial day pass canvassing gyms in my area, Shafi was friendly and showed me around when I arrived and explained well any inquiries that I had.

Will update my review to 5 if management can confirm that they have retired the broken step up and other potentially dangerous broken equipment. ✌️

Edit: Noticed that the potentially dangerous equipment are not in sight anymore (though hoping the replacement ones come soon), and changing area toilets are quite clean and smells good. Upping my rating 🙏",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRX1BMbFBBEAE

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Dr. Martha Tara Lee,1,"Dec 2023
My gym now. Something wrong with their rower. EXTREMELY stiff.

I joined a gym for a reason. To do my cardio out of the sun. To not exercise directly under the glare this sun, I have to exervise before 730am or after 730pm. This is how it looks at 830am! 830am!

I gave feedback before. Can you please move these cardio machines out of the direct Sun! I'm not the only one avoiding them during hot sun. I'm paying for membership. I'm making a third request. Do not ignore your members!

Update 9 April 2024. They finally replied to say they weren't moving machines and to please go ahead to go to other gyms.

It's 823am and that's how hot my gym is already. They refuse to move the machines. Need to change gym.

I like to exercise different hours of the day not just before the sun is up or when sun is down. This has impacted me a lot. I've been exercising less than I usually. I hate this gym and how uncaring they are.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWLXYzWFBREAE

I had also tried to contact them using the phone number that they provided on their website and I did not receive a response from them! It was only when I went to the gym to confront them then did they respond to my query. One of the worst services from an AF branch that I’ve received.

Furthermore, the equipment in the gym are not replaced when they are broken. For example, the step up boards that are in the free area have huge cracks in the middle which may be a falling hazard if someone steps in the middle and the board breaks into half.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2dmZ1ckxBEAE

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,A C,1,"Like others have mentioned, this gym has many issues. But the final straw for me was management's refusal to address an older middle aged couple who record explicit videos in the gym every morning, occupying equipment for over an hour to do so. They’ve been doing this all year. It’s disturbing to see a man taking close-up videos of his partner in see-through shorts, focusing on intimate areas like her crotch and her chest. No one wants to work out with that in the background. This couple also violates rules by storing their belongings in two separate lockers overnight.

With the combination of the lack of equipment and zero etiquette from members who would hog a bench, a lat pulldown and cable row/small cable all at the same time, you'd be hard pressed to even be able to do half of your workout. And only two benches here that are perpetually impossible to get on since there are only two. Which gym only has two folding benches?! I've seen much smaller AFs have up to 7 benches.

In short, I think the management here is so abysmal that it enables inappropriate behavior to thrive — from creepy filming to equipment hogging and unhygienic practices.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzc3M2b0xREAE

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Jamson Tan Han Yang,3,"I recently visited Anytime Fitness Grantral and wanted to share my experience. The gym is quite spacious, but there's a downside - during peak hours, the limited equipment often gets used up quickly, making it challenging to stick to your workout plan.

On the hygiene front, the toilet facilities could use some improvement. They don't always meet the cleanliness standards I'd expect in a gym.

One thing that really irked me was the lack of clear signage in the mat area during group lessons. I was in the middle of my ab workout, and an instructor asked me to move, disrupting my momentum. I politely explained that I was halfway through a set, but she insisted I relocate. This kind of interruption is frustrating and doesn't align with the expectations of dedicated gym-goers.

In conclusion, this is a decent gym, but I have concerns about the equipment availability and hygiene standards under the current management. It's essential for them to address these issues to retain dedicated customers.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ1dXZLSFN3EAE

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Olivia,2,"This is my home gym because I live 100m away but I would definitely recommend people to avoid this gym.
1) It is spacious but space is under-utilised. There is a huge free area that is just used for stretching/yoga??
2) There is both a lack of equipment and a lack of maintenance.
a. There is the uncommon glute bridge machine but no calf raise machine, high row machine or even vertical leg press machine (only the shitty horizontal one).
b. There is only one Smith machine.
c. And it gets worse: there is only one lat pulldown connected to one seated cable row and to two adjustable pulley towers. More often than not, you have to queue for them even during off-peak hours.
d. There are towels available but the alcohol spray bottle disappeared recently.
e. More often than not, the soap bottle is empty.
f. Toilets are not available in the gym itself and you must use the mall toilet.
3) There is no time limit on the use of equipment and/or attachments, so get ready to wait when people decide to use attachments for machines that the attachments aren’t even commonly used with so you can’t even share and they do 10+ sets with it for 40+ minutes.
4) Many people don’t bring towels (I’m not sure if it’s a rule in this gym, but I haven’t seen it enforced by the gym personnel anyway) and don’t wipe equipment after usage… the disappearance of alcohol spray bottles doesn’t help at all.

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Joseph Ng,2,"Good Points: Very spacious gym with good natural light. Polite staff. Decent selection of machine handles and supplementary equipment (bands/ab wheels/foam rollers..etc).

Bad Points: Bad use of space, equipment selection is BAD - only one bench/squat rack and one deadlift platform. Machines are not the traditional AF machines and thus do not have adjustable variable weights between plates (eg: if each machine weight plate is 2.5kg there's no option to add 1.25kg via a smaller adjustable plate). Air-conditioning is poor and half the fans remain off despite the temperature.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURKajZ1RVRREAE

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Jay,5,"I recently met Jas at Anytime Fitness in Gantral Complex and I’m so glad I did! Her customer service is just outstanding. She has this warm, welcoming vibe that makes you feel at ease the moment you meet her. It’s not just her friendliness, though; Jas really listens to what you’re looking for, making the whole experience super personalized and enjoyable.

But it’s not only her customer service skills that impressed me. Jas knows her stuff when it comes to the gym and its equipment. She gave me a rundown on the best machines for my workout plan and some great fitness tips. It’s clear she’s not just doing her job; she genuinely wants to help people get the best out of their gym time.

So, if you’re thinking of joining Anytime Fitness at Gantral Complex, make sure to look for Jas. Whether it’s getting familiar with the gym or sorting out your membership, she’s your person. Her blend of top-notch customer service and gym expertise makes the whole process a breeze!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN0dnFtalR3EAE
Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Jonathan Boon,3,"Pros: If you're here for leg day, they've got you covered with plenty of leg machines, including harder to find ones, such as a hip thrust machine, hack squat and a perfect squat machine.
Cons: If you're here for upper body, you're in for a bad time. No Pec/Rear Delt Fly machine, no rows except for the 2 cable flys which everyone will be waiting for.
Air Conditioning is absolutely abysmal here. It can be warmer inside the gym that it is outside. Some of the fans aren't even in working condition.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURONzZLeVFBEAE

Anytime Fitness Grantral Complex,Clement Teh,3,"Located in revamped Citimac Industrial building now call Grantral is in proximity to coach terminal that brings you to Malaysia. It also has a good choice if asian food and hardly any that keeps promotes healthy diet like most places. There are also gymnastic training next door where you cab leave your kid there while you work out. Anytime Fitness however,  lacks built in lavatories but dont have shower rooms. They also don't seem to carry the set of machines older branches have, so this can be disruptive if you are an old member. There is also a short of staff and maintenance in the place. Stray weights are everywhere and users are using the machines wrongly without staff advising. There seems to be an interest in the excercise machine for glutz here.

The facilities, gym equipment & the staff there is nice. They are friendly & willing to help.
