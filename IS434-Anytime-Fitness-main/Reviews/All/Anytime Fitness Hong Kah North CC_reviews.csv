Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Benedict Correya,4,"A well-maintained and spacious gym with a great range of equipment for both strength training and cardio. The place is kept clean, and the air-conditioning makes workouts comfortable even during hot days. The staff are friendly and approachable, and the overall environment feels safe and welcoming. Convenient location within the community centre, making it easy to drop by for a quick workout anytime. Overall, a great place for a workout — though the lighting could be improved to make the space feel brighter and more energizing.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25oM00wTmxkV0ZITFVob2RHRjVUVXRaWHpBek1GRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Steph Zzz,5,"Very clean and well maintained gym, staff is friendly and helpful too. The gym does not have a weighing scale or water cooler (only located 1 floor below the gym) but considering the size of the gym I guess it’s fine…? The equipment in the gym is more than sufficient for a full body workout. Will visit here more often as the vibes here is top notch!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5alpEajhBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Aqil Sancho,5,"I came to this gym for the first time and realised that the gym is so much more cleaner compared to those I have been to. The staffs were very helpful in helping me find the toilet and water cooler.

But the only downside is that there are no showering facilities and toilet and water cooler is at level 3.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUa09idHFnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Putri Farhanahh,5,"the service there was good. it was my first time gymming alone and i was unsure on how to use it. yusri helped me & he was very patient. he explain how the machine works & he went an extra mile to ensure if i know how the other machines work. it really made going to the gym less scarier, deserve 5 stars for him 🙏🏼 …",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3NU1IRl9BRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Lim Wei Zhe,3,"Place is nice and decent equipment, but felt like salesperson was too pushy and took very long to go through the sign up process. When i stated there were some info that i was uncomfortable with answering, i had to reject quite a few times before probing stopped. Was abit misleading on price as well as i was attracted to sign up by a board saying discounted price but when i arrived and halfway through consultation, it was stated the offer is not valid anymore.

Many ppl i know went to trials at several AF to decide on which home gym they wanted, but here states that i can only get trial at their location if I have never trialed at any AF before. Want a trial? Sign up and get a trial. Whats the point of asking for a trial then?

However, you deal with that and will be able to enjoy a decent gym!. Unhappy with service, but the gym is decent. Tho it does not have shower facilities as it uses CC toilet on separate floor.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREOUx6Uk13EAE
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Gene Simmons,5,The cleanliness and cosiness of this gym is simply unmatchable. Love the strong aircon and the newness of all the equipments. Also it is really really clean! Love that they provide sanitiser sprays and cloths to wipe down the machines.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOcHNqb0JnEAE
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Stephen Tjai,5,"I am not sure what the one star review was expecting, this Anytime Fitness opened for people near Bukit Gombak and of course using the CC facilities they are constrained and not as large as the mall or standalone ones.

I have been to various Anytime gyms in town like City Hall, Orchard and HarbourFront and of course those are larger. Bukit Batok one is big as well but it is highly inconvenient for people living around Gombak as it is a far walk and one must walk further into the country club.

This gym although small, it is adequate for my needs and if I want heavier weights I take from other machines and put them back. It is opposite my place and very convenient. I understand using the CC toilets in order to save space and this gym maximize the amount of space used. Friendly staff, good equipments, strong air-con and convenience factor, I love this gym already.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1Z05DUnVnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Zavier,3,"Been to this gym a couple of times since opening,

Pros of the gym:
1) Strong Aircon
2) Accessible
3) Equipments are new and sufficient for workout

Cons of Gym:
1) No toilet
2) No water cooler- need to go Level3
3) No showering facilities
4) Abit too small, can imagine it being super squeezy during peak hour crowds
5) Only 2 racks

Points of Improvement :
1) Not enough Olympic barbells (only 2)
2) Spotlight is directly on top of the rack, super blinding to the eyes when doing bench press

Edited on Dec23 as I noted gym has added new equipments and benches. there more than sufficient benches now.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1d2J1bWhRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Hong Kah North CC,Shanmugapriya Sivaraman,1,I am member of anytime fitness and wanted to cancel my membership as my pass got expired and I am moving out of Singapore. I shared my STP pass to them and still they delayed cancelling my membership. I sent an email for cancellation  on February and got an email reply by March after followup which put me in a situation to pay extra for two months which is a total of 170 SGD +110 SGD for cancellation.  Really very disappointed with their email followup and support at this branch.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM5LWRHeWRnEAE
