Anytime Fitness Novena,Roger Thomas Tan,5,"Great place, spacious with a space for machines, free weights and squat rack! Nicely decorated changing room. It wasn’t very crowded when I was there in the afternoon so it’s a good place to gym if you are in Novena area. Plus it’s tucked away in the open basement area in a cozy little corner in front of the building, with lots of bright sunlight to make it rather pleasant and cheerful. The management are nice, smiled and said hi to me even though it’s my first time there. I recommend this place to gym!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYM3JxRU1BEAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Sihan Goi,3,"Came here on a Monday over lunch. Reached at close to noon and it was getting crowded, by 12+, it was packed. Thankfully, the platform wasn't very popular, though someone did hijack it while I was stretching even though my stuff was there. I didn't really mind since I'm all for sharing, but I thought a little courtesy in asking if the platform is being used would be nice. The platform was also squeezed in between the wall and a pillar, so there's not much space to navigate.

The squat racks were however hot items...except not for squatting. Since it's Monday, apparently everyone was celebrating National Bench Day. I had to wait a while before I could squat.

The equipment is quite alright, though they are all placed in very close proximity to one another, so you need to be very aware of where your going to not intrude on someone else's space. There are 2 full racks with rubberized plays from 1.25-20kg, 4 bars within the racks, another bar on the platform, a full set of Hammer Strength bumper plates, a smith machine, various benches, dumbells till about 35kg, various cable machines and cardio equipment. Nothing out of the ordinary, no specialized bars or other equipment.

The bathroom is unisex, and the water pressure fluctuates, and can get quite low when someone else is showering.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfZ09LUUpBEAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Fi Yb,1,"Other branches of anytime fitness are ok. However, the management at this branch is extremely chaotic, and they have repeatedly charged me incorrectly. The owner is a bald man with a tattoo on his head. The key he gave me at first didn’t even work, and he asked me to pay extra to replace it. In December 2024, they charged me incorrectly again — luckily, I noticed after doing the math. Then in February 2025, I asked them to terminate my membership by April 15, but they kept delaying it with all sorts of excuses. When I brought up the incorrect charges, they even said the staff should pay me back themselves. They’re completely passing the buck.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZOEtfZ2ZREAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Shine cleo Butar butar,5,"Staff are great and lots of equipment. Facility is clean and tidy... Open 24/7 convenient, Close to home.
And the ability to go to any of their locations when traveling.
Would definitely recommend Anytime Fitness Novena Singapore to anyone looking for a new gym 👍🏻",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNScnU2TW5nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Bryan,2,"Staff was rather rude when asking me to move my personal belongings. Limited machines (in comparison to other outlets), and dumbbells were only up to 40kg (more an issue for monsters out there who require heavier). I suppose the only saving grace was the decent leg press and plate loaded hammer strength row.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJaHJ5Vk1REAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Shuaib Shah,5,"This is a superb gym with excellent management and service, led by Ms May

I am a foreign tourist visiting Singapore for a few weeks and booked Novena Anytime Fitness 1 month membership at SGD 155

No registration fee or lock-in!

Ms May was fantastic and very very helpful

The gym facilities are excellent and I would use this again

Highly recommended",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSb0piQ293RRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Happy S,1,"I would give it a 5 (because of the complete equipment) if not because of the pungent sharp air freshener/ perfume which i heard is toxic. I understand if they want to eliminate body odor but they can use it proportionately, or clean more often, or have better air conditioning, instead of overloading the room with perfume. I started to develop abit of headache. Too pitty it used to be my favourite place to work out, now i have to move to other anytime fitness which is inconvenience for me",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURBNmZPV2VREAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Ryan Quek,5,"Nice roomy gym with friendly instructors! Showers, changing rooms and lockers available so super convenient. Lots of machines  to go around so you don't have to wait too long. Highly recommended!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYb3M2YXFnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Navin Kuna,1,"I wish there was an option to give no stars. This place is only friendly and cooperative until the sign-up is confirmed and the terms and conditions are signed. After that, their behavior completely changes—they become rude, threaten customers, and force decisions that only benefit them, even when the customer is dealing with medical or severe financial difficulties. The service is utterly poor.

To anyone considering signing up, please don’t do it if you genuinely value your passion for fitness and keeping yourself healthy. Only sign up if you have excess money to waste because that’s all they care about.

Not only did I experience this, but my colleagues also faced threats and were scammed into paying more, even after submitting a cancellation request well before the 30-day notice period stated in their clause. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the comment sections on other platforms about Anytime Fitness, and you’ll see how many others have suffered too.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2cWNuY1hnEAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Princess Pongyan,5,"So much love for this gym - Friendly and approachable staff, spacious, clean and well maintained and most of all the gym smells good and that's all that matters. Ahahaha! My favourite go-to AF gym 🥰💯♥️ …",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwNVkyLWhnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Chili Red Arowana,1,"It’s at B1, at a corner next to Cold Storage.. it’s very Ulu place, in an old mall.. and not near MRT. The nearest is Novena MRT, looks near but it’s a long zig zag walk, crossing the bridge to get here. Quite confusing. I’d say not worth the effort. Worse part is the shower cubicle has very smelly URINE smell. Disgusting outlet",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNnOGJmbzNBRRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Luis L.,5,"I've been in Singapore for more than 10 years and been in quite a number of Anytime Fitness across the island. This is for sure, the best of all.

The facilities are impeccable, providing a clean and comfortable environment for workouts (everything is quite new), good location and ambience. However, what truly made it stand out was the staff (I would totally call out some comments below; the impression from the staff is a bit confusing). For me, they are friendly, encouraging, and highly knowledgeable, going above and beyond to assist and motivate me. This gym is a true gem, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a positive fitness journey.

This is the best gym you can find in Novena!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwN3NtbS1BRRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,BT,5,Zac was prompt in assisting my membership and answering my queries. Thanks for following up well!,,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xaaVZFWXdZWEZZVDJwMU5ITlRjSGxyVmxGTVJYYxAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Randall Han,1,"I recently visited this gym and was met with  an unpleasant and condescending staff. I made a long trip down but forgot my fob and instead of offering a solution, the male staff asked me which gym I was from in a dismissive tone. When I told him I was from another outlet and asked if he could manually register my fob number, he rudely said that I should go back to my ""home club"".

I was appalled by this staff member's behaviour. I have been a long-time member Anytime Fitness, and have never had such a poor experience. It had also ultimately influenced my decision to cancel my membership.

It's clear that this particular outlet doesn't value its customers, or at least customers not from their club. I would advise anyone considering this gym to look at other outlets. It’s a pity as the gym facilities in itself were new and spacious but is tainted by the service. Also does no justice to the Anytime fitness brand.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNllTODJ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Novena,Cheen the Curious,5,"Enjoying convenience of 24-hour access; gym has its own entrance, separate from mall. Good lighting, spacious & well laid out.

Anytime Fitness Novena,K I,1,"Adequate equipment, though can feel small at times. Agree with the comments regarding odor…sometimes there and sometimes not there, but not overwhelming. The area of improvement for me is in the area of customer service.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYNUtYekhREAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Bobby Muljono,3,"Pros: location is pretty good, especially since it is in a mall, which is quite rare for an AF outlet to be. Equipment are all clean and servicable, couple of squat racks, 1 smith machine, 1 DL platform and overall a very well-equipped gym for and AF outlet, mostly new but can spot some of them re-used or procured from a different outlet as the plates are inconsistent.

Cons: this is gonna be a very biased portion of the but i came from another gym with high ceiling and it makes a lot of difference. The low ceiling means its a bit more stuffy and the stench of sweat just wafts through the air, making my workout just less than pleasant. Not sure about other outlets but toilet is mixed gender and open-concept, which is a first for me in any gym and i've been to activeSG gyms with basic toilets that are gender-separated. Weights are all re-racked but its difficult to see any indication of which plates/dumbbell goes to which rack, so you can often see 10kg plates are the bottom rack and 20kg plates at the upper rack, which poses a hazard. Same for dumbbells, racked but all over the place.

Another biased point is i've been in another gym that offers towel service which ultimately results in an overall cleaner equipment because almost everyone uses a towel whereas AF gym-goers are only about half of them using towel.

Not a bad free trial session but will not be pursuing a membership with them after striking a couple of deal-breakers. Will most likely extend my membership with my current gym.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOa3NEVUR3EAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,wk tang,3,Gym is well-equipped. Good music. Clean shower. Customer service could be better especially when explaining the membership contract.

Anytime Fitness Novena,Lily Chua,5,"Came here with my husband after our medical appointment and was impressed by the friendly staff and the spacious gym with a vast array of equipment. The trainer, Dave, as well as a more senior trainer (whom I didn’t get his name) helped to guide my husband and me in using the equipment, which made our experience an extremely pleasant one. Thank you!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSX2FyY0JBEAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,James Cheng,1,"Hi I would like to feedback on uncalled for remarks by a certain gentleman from Anytime Fitness Novena Gym during a visit on 20th Jan 1120am with my Spouse.  We had signed up for Anytime Fitness Membership at Ang Mo Kio South recently on Tuesday 16th Jan and had visited Anytime Fitness Junction 9 yesterday as our first gym session. As we had enjoyed ourselves at Junction 9 with the warm introduction and hospitality treatment from AJ, the staff at Junction 9. We were beaming with excitement to come for our second gym session at Novena as our daughter is attending extra classes here. During our visit to the Novena gym, we saw a man unable to enter the outlet despite tapping his fob several times. I tried next and I could enter. My Spouse following after me next tried to tap her fob too but likewise similar to the man whom can't enter despite tapping, her tapping to enter was denied too. And this particular gentleman whom is not decked in any Anytime Fitness attire and behaving like the Boss of this outlet happened to come walking over and ask what had happened at the entrance. We shared with him that we were not able to enter despite tapping, he proclaimed loudly it must be the case of us defaulting on payment without even bothering to check if the issues lies with his gym entry system. Is it the attitude or the way Anytime Fitness handles issues? Without even checking up on anything, is the staff supposed to voice such comment?",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUROaUpfdmFnEAE
Anytime Fitness Novena,Shivaram Kumar,1,would give 0 stars if possible. Came to this branch to enquire about the facilities and fees. The staff I spoke to was the manager in charge of the branch i think (thats what he told me). Can't remember his name but he was extremely rude and unpleasant to talk to. Came to check out the facilities and prices but he was not helpful at all and had the most condescending tone. Left the place within 5 mins so as to not waste my time.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqa19XeWN3EAE
