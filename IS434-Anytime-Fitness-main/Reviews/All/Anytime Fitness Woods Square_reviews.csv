Anytime Fitness Woods Square,Jun Hao Chuang (Benchuang),5,"I joined as first-timer and was fortunate to be coached by Frederick. He guided me patiently on how to use the machines correctly and helped adjust my posture to get the most out of every workout. He also provided me with a practical diet plan, and within a week of consistent training and following the plan, I managed to lose about 3kg. I really appreciate his guidance and the supportive environment here, it’s been a great start to my fitness journey.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pGTk1tTkliRlpNVW05T1lXWlZSRUpUVUc1M1dIYxAB

Anytime Fitness Woods Square,Dev Subramaniam,5,"Have been to this gym for more than 5 years. I met frederick (male PT) only relatively recently at the gym, when he approached me of his own accord after overhearing a conversation I had with a fellow gym-goer about my upcoming men's physique show. Ever since, he has been extremely forthcoming and helpful, taking the time to teach me how to pose, knowing that I had been preparing myself up to this point. He has demonstrated tremendous expertise in all matters bodybuilding related, and it comes as no surprise considering his long list of achievements as both a competitor and coach. I am truly grateful to him for his generosity and kindness - if he has helped me so much thus far as a friend with no expectations of receiving an engagement, just imagine how much he can help you as your personal trainer. I highly recommend him to all fitness enthusiasts regardless of experience or background.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xCdmF6ZGxhMjVXVHpVM1drZzJPRFJRYlVaU1dsRRAB

All the staff is friendly except for that one fellow who has his face all over the gym winning the bodybuilding competition. Trainer, auto should be friendly right? Oh no, not this fellow. Asked to use machine for his clients as we are invading his space. Respect all AF users, not only your clients, thats my advice. Be Better.

Anytime Fitness Woods Square,Phebe Kwek,5,"100% recommend Coach Frederick if you’re looking for a Physical Trainer! He puts in his 100% all the time and gives you his fullest attention during sessions. He makes sessions fun but still ensure you complete all your workouts. (which really helps when you feel like dying halfway through) The decision to engage him was life changing in more ways than one — I did not just gain a fitness instructor, I also gained a friend. #coachbyfred",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s5ZlkyUlZTVnBYTTBJNVJFNVhTSGRNTWt4VlZHYxAB

Anytime Fitness Woods Square,Hd Sh,1,"Gym Trainer thinks that as long as he makes a lot of noise counting reps and having noisy conversations, he is doing work and motivates the trainee.

Poor service and restrictive terms overall.

The gym is pretty crowded.

No bathrooms and the showers are badly maintained with vain guys flexing at the sink all the time.

Not enough racks and weights or pigeonholes.

Stupid rule about not using the tables and chairs but staff don't know how to use tables and chairs.

Water cooler is not cold and located strategically at the heavy weights.

Music is okay .",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMcUN1WUt0d2R1dS1BRRAB

I was happy to support their business, but their management of the cancellation of subscription has made me think otherwise. We need a one month lead time to cancel the subscription, which I followed, but due to the lack of reply on their end, it would be unlikely that I can get it cancelled timely.

Anytime Fitness Woods Square,Najat Yusuf,3,"Been a member since June 2024.
Big space and lots of equipment available to do a full body workout.

Playlist /music is always good, sometimes too loud but it's good working out music!

Does require a lot of housekeeping. The functional area needs to be neatened up and the floor mats might need to be replaced, and the benches need to be changed too.

It would be good to enforce better rules (BIG SIGNS) so members know how one should place the weights back after using them. It is more of a member problem, but it might help if members often see staff on the floor doing their duty to tidy up. Seeing a messy unkept gym is a turnoff and it spoils the mood for workout.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIeWVuYlFnEAE

And it wouldn't hurt to borrow a charger to charge my device for a short while during staffed hours, unlike how the previous older staff handled such a small matter. Additionally, the cleaning lady takes several hours to clean the cubicle and leaves the trash bag right there, which is very unhygienic. The shower cubicle is meant for members to take a shower, so I don't understand why I got scolded by the cleaning lady just because the shower floor was wet in the cubicle, she slammed the door so loudly in anger.

Subscription to this gym is worst than taking a bad loan. They will charge late fee of $14.98 even if you are late by one day. Then few days later claim to have another auto deduction (forced) without consent and if failed, will charge again another $14.98 in the same month.

I felt helpless and when you complain, they do not listen and totally not flexible at all.

Anytime Fitness Woods Square,Val Lim,1,"Bad experience with their staff. Their cancellation policies before meeting the 18 month minimum commitment period does not make any sense.

I have to pay one month gym membership fee in full on top of a $100 cancellation fee even though I was asked to stop strenuous exercise with immediate effect (with doctor memo).
I wrote in to appeal to waive off the one month membership because I can’t use the facilities at all with immediate effect as advised by my doctor.

I wonder how am I supposed to predict that I will be unwell and email AF 1 month in advance to avoid paying 1 month of gym membership for nothing?

If i were to use the gym for a month while claiming that I am unfit, then what purpose will the doctor memo serve? Wouldn’t the memo be a scam?

Hence, their cancellation rules are really rigid, contradicting and unreasonable.
Do read carefully and consider all aspects before signing up unless you are willing to pay while not using the facilities at all.

There are many other gyms w more flexible rules.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcTUycHlBRRAB

I was also training with JK. He's helped me greatly with my fitness journey by teaching me the basics and more. I suffer from various health issues that make it difficult for me to become fit safely. Despite that, JK was very patient and managed to tailor a perfect plan for me according to my health. His willingness to help me really motivated me.

- Quite spacious
- A variety of equipments including 3 power racks.

Cons:
- Always crowded
- Barbells/Dumbells/Plates are too rusty
- Free weights area too cramped
- A number of the users lack gym etiquette. ""Chopeing"" machines. Do not rerack after using weights.
- Too many ""social media influencers"" with tripods around taking up space. So you'll have watch where you walk so as not to ""interfere"" or be in their workout videos.
- At a particular timing, there'll be groups of kids/guys working out in a group whilst clowning around and hogging up equipments.

Conclusion:
Not a great gym if you're serious about working out.
Not a great crowd and their choice of music is not the kind that you'll be hyped about.
