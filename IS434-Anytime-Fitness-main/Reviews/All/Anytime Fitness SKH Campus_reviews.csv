Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Vignesh Ganesan,5,"I’ve been a regular at this gym for a while now, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience. The facilities are clean, well-maintained, and equipped with everything you need for a great workout. The overall atmosphere is friendly and motivating, which makes it a place I genuinely look forward to coming to.

A special mention to my personal trainer, Georgina—she’s been absolutely fantastic! She takes the time to understand my goals, health needs, and fitness levels, and customizes each workout to suit me perfectly. Her encouragement, patience, and expertise keep me motivated throughout every session. Thanks to her guidance, I feel stronger, healthier, and more confident each day.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT20xdVVHb3RkVzVFVDFReFgxSlNlVWQwZVVWamMzYxAB
Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Min Toh,5,"I was quite apprehensive to join the gym initially as I'm a total newbie to fitness. But the decision to join and train with Georgina has been one of the best decisions that I've made for my health. Georgina is very patient and very knowledgeable. Under her guidance, I gained much progress in my fitness, health and confidence. She takes time to explain and teach me the correct forms and what to look out for and will adjust to my level. She is friendly, firm and encouraging. Due to her coaching, I was encouraged to keep strength training as part of my routine.
The gym is clean, well maintained and I always feel comfortable here. I also find the gym at SKH very well equipped compared to some other AF that I went to.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pJMmFFcFBOMEpaZVV0alFsSTRSRXBpZUhodWFuYxAB
Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Adilah,5,"Had the privilege of training with Shahrul at AF SKH, and I’m beyond grateful for his guidance and motivation throughout my fitness journey. Thank you, Shahrul, for always pushing me (even when I complained 😅) and for sharing so much of your knowledge and experience. You’ve taught me not just how to train better, but how to stay consistent, disciplined, and intentional.

It’s been such a rewarding journey, and I’ve grown stronger both physically and mentally thanks to your patience and encouragement. Really couldn’t have asked for a better trainer to start this journey with. 💪🏼",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21GaVVXMDVNemhoZGpWWU5ERkdjMkZDTFdSRVpuYxAB
Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Mark,5,"Been here for over a year. Honestly one of the better AF gyms in SG. Very well maintained, and the staff team care a lot about running the gym. Very responsive to enquiries and even decorates the gym with the festive seasons.

Downsides: Can get very crowded sometimes (Sengkang issue), and the aircon might be too weak for some, especially when there are a lot of people in the gym",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tKcWRqRmtUUzA1U0hWRmQwNURTV0Y2TUMxcVJsRRAB

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Samara “MARA” M,1,First time visiting this branch and chased out for improper shoes??? It was covered leather slides. Never been an issue in other branches. Staff member did not even introduce herself and straight up told me to leave after I warmed up. Did not offer alternatives. What is the point of being so strict we are all adults?

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,DD,4,"Been coming to this gym for almost a year even though it’s not my main one, just for a change of environment sometimes. Staff and manager are really friendly which is great. Only thing is the music- it’s mostly old school songs and doesn’t really hype people up to train. Would be awesome if the playlist could be more upbeat. Thanks!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xGWmEzWlRVVTlhVFMxRWJrZG9XR2xyU0VGSFJWRRAB

The staff are very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend my coach, Shahrul — he is attentive, professional, and meticulous about correcting my posture in every detail.

He makes the most of our rest time by checking in on my nutrition and generously sharing his knowledge. Through our sessions, I’ve not only gained physical strength but also developed a deeper understanding of how our body and muscles work.

Training with Coach Shahrul has been consistently pleasant and rewarding — I always look forward to our sessions.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xZd2VrSlpVbFIxTXpkSGFrWjNaVGh1WkhWWFNtYxAB

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Addison Montgomery,1,"LONG OVERDUE REVIEW:

I had 1.5 yrs subscription, but seldom visited the gym because on the first day I was supposed to start, I asked the staff if he can show me around the gym as I wasn't familiar with the equipments - he said this is pretty much it and then a patron laughed at my face. Well it is funny, the place is quite small.
I am pretty self conscious already having to start going to the gym alone, that interaction pretty much ruined it for me. Wanna get a membership again but definitely not in this branch, it's small and doesn't even have classes!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURveUliUjRnRRAB

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,T Maruthuvel,4,I have been coming for quite a while now. Great gym spacious and clean. Don't have much interaction with the staff but they seem to be friendly. They have been adding new stuff like the attachment rack. Would be 5 stars if they had some rarer equipments such as hack squat/pendulum squat/machine lateral raise.,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3ei1TcFJ3EAE
Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Wilson Zhang,5,"If you’re looking to learn strength training safely, I can highly recommend reaching out to the trainers at SKHCampus. Having trained at this gym with Shahrul as my trainer for the last 9 months, I can attest to his high level of professionalism in tailoring and executing a program suitable to your workout objectives, commitment to client safety, and above all he possesses a positive attitude for those who appreciate a kind and warm trainer!

-

Having no real training in weightlifting and a several injuries, I was encouraged by a fellow gym member’s stellar review of Shahrul and sought his coaching to help gain muscles and joint stability.

Here’s some notable experiences in my journey thus far:

1. Looking to YouTube for exercise guidance does not make up for having an experienced trainer who can tailor exercises suitable for your needs and provide immediate feedback on joint positioning and simply if you’re doing the exercises effectively and safely. I now know with greater certainty after training with Shahrul what exercises to perform at the gym, and can confidently do them safely and that helps a lot in being consistent!

2. Nutrition is a key focus for building muscle mass. I was tracking macros prior to this but Shahrul goes above and beyond to tailor my  caloric plan and macros based on my needs as they evolve - from recomp, to bulking and now a cut. The gym also has in-house body scanner to estimate muscle and fat mass which is used for monthly check-in on progress.

3. “Homework” is assigned as beyond the two one hour sessions with Shahrul, he provides a list of exercises, set and rep ranges and additional guidance for self-training to hit all muscle groups sufficiently. This helped me understand what exercises to focus on consistently over the months and learn a routine for myself as I progress to self-training. Myself for instance I have to focus on training my lats, hamstrings and glutes more as they respond slower to stimulus.

4. Rest and recovery are also as important as that’s when muscles grow. Shahrul provided lots of great advice to help me get healthier beyond just the workouts in the gym.

I hope this helps if you have suffered from injuries and generally trying to achieve some fitness goals to reach out to Shahrul for a consultation. Cheers.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvb09MLVBnEAE

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Bubbly Banana,5,"Been going to this gym for about 6 months now. My first time entering this gym, I must've looked a little lost because the staff at the front desk asked if it was my first time here, and then proceeded to point out where the lockers were. That was nice.

When I was just starting out, multiple people here also voluntarily gave me tips on my form when they saw me performing the exercise wrongly, which I found really wholesome and appreciated. People here are also usually very willing to share equipment. Most people also wipe down the equipment after use. The equipment is well-maintained, no complaints whatsoever.

There is only one downside; it gets pretty crowded 4pm onwards, and sometimes even at 11pm its still pretty crowded. So I usually try to go late morning/early afternoon. Despite that, Anytime Fitness SKH still deserves 5 stars. I don't smile much, but just wanna let the staff know I appreciate this place. Keep up the good work.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2dnR1WUVBEAE

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Matthew Song,5,"The facility and equipment are good. As a beginner, I definitely have no complaints. It can get a bit crowded during certain times, which given its size is expected. It's not small, but not big either. I'd say it's appropriate to serve the number of staff and community near by.

There are a few showers, the toilet outside is close enough to not be inconvenient and there's a decent amount of space to put your bags.

All the staff are extremely friendly and supportive, with special shoutout to my trainer Sharul. If not for him, I doubt I'd be where I am today.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfcm95V2VnEAE

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Jensen Tan,5,"first time ever entering into a gym and needed a personal trainer. I was very fortunate to have personal trainer Shahrul to guide me in my 24-session journey. He's very patient, friendly, and makes me comfortable and at ease every time I train with him.

It was a fruitful self-discovery journey with him also, where beyond just trying to bulk up, I gained useful knowledge on my diet, the value of building strength into old age, having a mental space to relax during workouts, and building good health habits. It definitely has given me positive impact to my overall well-being.

I would recommend anyone to go with a personal trainer (esp newbies) as it helps to ensure that you can develop good postures, avoid injuries, and a source of motivation. Shahrul is a great help in Sengkang area so I highly recommend him!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2aS1yTXJnRRAB

Whenever I exercise, he always focuses on watching each of my movements carefully to ensure they are correct, correcting my posture to prevent injury.

After our sessions, he plans out a workout schedule for me to follow, including specific weights and sets. Even when he's not around, I have a structured training plan to follow, so I know exactly what exercises to do without wasting time at the gym. I remember during my last InBody measurement, the results were not as expected. Although I usually exercise diligently, I haven't been controlling my diet properly, and I also dislike doing aerobic exercise. I can feel that he is even sadder than I am because he once told me that seeing his students make progress bit by bit gives him a great sense of achievement and happiness. After that day, I set clear goals for myself. I explicitly told him what I wanted, and he actively helped me plan my daily calorie intake and advised me on my daily nutritional needs. With his provided training regimen, I diligently followed through. In just three weeks, I successfully reduced over 3% body fat and gained 1 kg of muscle. Initially, I doubted my abilities, but because of his dedication and encouragement, I was inspired to strive for my goals.

I also admire his passion for every student. Regardless of how early or late it is, he accommodates his students' schedules. Whether during class or privately, he's always enthusiastic to answer any questions and find solutions to my problems.

If you're looking to start your fitness journey but don't know where to begin, I sincerely recommend finding Shahrul. He won't be harsh on you, but he'll listen to your needs seriously. He customizes workouts based on each person's weaknesses, helping you fall in love with fitness and become better!

I'm truly grateful to have met such an amazing coach because he has helped me become better and better! His guidance has been instrumental in my fitness journey, and I'm immensely grateful for his support.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqanBUNnZBRRAB

Anytime Fitness SKH Campus,Venkatesh Visvanathan,5,"When I first joined Anytime Fitness, it had been 20 years since I had last exercised at the gym. I remember feeling hesitant and anxious about restarting my fitness journey, given my age and lack of experience. However, my personal trainer, Sharul, helped me regain my confidence and realise that age is just a number when it comes to fitness. Every session, he would give his 200% to guide me through various exercises while ensuring I was doing alright and able to cope with the intensity of the exercises. He would encourage me to push myself but at the same time show me how I can modify exercises to gradually build up my strength. Sharul is knowledgeable, friendly, accomodating, dedicated and very committed and I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to embark on their fitness journey. Under his training, I am sure they too will be able to gain confidence in themselves, and become motivated to put in consistent effort to see growth in small steps, just like how I did!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN6dDgyOWR3EAE
