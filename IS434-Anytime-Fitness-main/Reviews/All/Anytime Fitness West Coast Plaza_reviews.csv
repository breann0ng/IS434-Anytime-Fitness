Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Muhammad Zulfadly Bin Abdul Manap,4,"The gym floor is spacious after renovation. It is more powerlifting friendly - 3 deadlift platforms, 3 squat racks. Couldn't say the same for the plates which are aging and worn. Plenty of machines for legs like hip thrust, hack squats. Too bad most of the gym-goera here couldn't appreciate this. They have a spacious functional training area and group classes too. There are plenty of shower stalls here as well. This would be an ideal outlet for me if it wasn't for the distance (i live in Yishun).",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2w5SWVYQkhNa2REVjNOa04xOUlkRTFxYjBGTE9WRRAB
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Ribeye,5,"Anytime Fitness at West Coast Plaza is a modern, well-equipped gym. Accessible 24/7, this branch is particularly spacious.
With a wide range of cardio and strength training equipment, a functional training area, free weights, and spaces for class.
The gym's atmosphere is conducive and well maintained. Overall a clean, spacious environment for users in the area.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREa091TFlREAE
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Jenny Yew,5,"I've been training at Anytime Fitness West Coast for over two months now, and I just want to give a big shoutout to my personal trainer, David. I have a torn meniscus and my knee tends to get inflamed very easily, so I was initially quite hesitant about strength training. But David has been incredibly attentive and knowledgeable—always adjusting the workouts to suit my condition while still helping me make real progress.

Over the past couple of months, I’ve noticed a big improvement—my knee gets less inflamed, and my leg feels noticeably stronger. I’m really happy with the results so far and grateful for the care and guidance I’ve received.

Also, I really like this outlet—it’s spacious, clean and well-equipped, which makes the training experience even more comfortable and enjoyable. Highly recommend David and this location if you’re looking for a supportive and effective training environment, especially if you’re working with an injury or need a more tailored approach.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNvM3ZHX3RRRRAB
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,ACKSHAL R,5,"I've been training with Lisa for the past few months, and I'm impressed with her ability to quickly assess my strengths and weaknesses and develop a training plan that addresses my specific goals. She is also very patient, understanding, and friendly.

I saw many negative comments about the gym and gym atmosphere. Don't believe those reviews. The gym is very clean, and the staff and trainers are very friendly.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3aHRQbzlBRRAB

Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Zaty Roslan,4,"Gym is clean and theres this signature scent every time you come in. Tried visiting everyday in the evening the past week and it gets crowded from 5pm. Can be a little squeezy then. Appreciate the free space area for stretching or classes. Signed up for PT with Lisa who is very friendly, gives sound advice and encouraging.

Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Himaja Kanna,5,"Before joining Anytime Fitness I had no knowledge about training in the gym. But after having training sessions with trainer Lisa, she has helped me give an introduction on how to use the gym equipment and enjoy working out. Highly recommend joining, gym is open 24 hours making it extremely convenient for busy students like me.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3eUpDZ3ZRRRAB
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Engracia Toh,5,"Staff are friendly and the gym is big. It's not as fancy as those central gyms (like city hall) but there's a lot of equipment and space (and isn't as horribly crowded as central gyms lol). It also looks nicer after the recent renovation. Definitely good if you live in the area.

Also, my trainer Lisa is very friendly and helps a lot with my workout form and motivation at the gym. Have seen tangible improvements in the past 4 months (I go around 2-3 times a week: 1-2 pt sessions and 1 session on my own). Would definitely recommend for people with no experience trying to get over gym anxiety and build their basics

But female toilet soap dispenser still keeps getting stuck :<. Would appreciate if that was fixed. Also, if possible, a more advanced body composition machine would be great to help track our gains!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3Mk02U2FBEAE

Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Moony Lmm,1,"Terrible sound system and song choice. I am not sure it’s club or gym. Low maintenance!. If one machine is out of order, it will take forever to be repaired. Cable machine is terribly old. I wrote an email to provide feedback. I never got a reply. They were pretty quick to follow up when they started open up. Who knows? they never care of paying customers anymore after they got enough base people to get running. Treadmill belts - they are rusty and making a lot of noises, at least two out of three I tried. Hopefully there is another competitive gym providers in the neighborhoods and I am happy to switch.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQbHJ6ektREAE

Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,******,1,"The whole gym ensues a very unwelcoming vibes, unfriendly admin and PT! Allow friends who are not a staff there to enter the “staff only” room and stayed in there for quite a while, the R&R there excludes their own friends and relative of course. The admin and PT there often show the unfriendly and unhappy faces as if members owe them a living! Equipments were not well maintained too, when things are down, they will take their own sweet time to have them repaired. Feedbacks often went unheard and ignored. Limited lockers too, such a big gym yet only a few lockers. Other AF we been to were very well maintained with friendly and helpful staffs but definitely not this one!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyZ09mNHRBRRAB
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Yong L,1,"One of the AF gym outlets which is not so well managed.

Covid-19 poster remains on the wall at water cooler. Water source from water cooler tasted funky. No maintenance at all. If a poster remains on the wall, let us not talked about having filters changed at appropriate intervals. Water cooler located in toilet can be quite unhygienic too. Such a poster which is no longer valid remains on the wall for such a long time says a lot of managing the facility.

Gym lacks(not enough) proper clean, up paper towels and sanitiser.

Would the owner even care?",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIN3BhczRBRRAB
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Elaine Ng,1,"Honestly if you have tried our other AF gyms you will realise that the customer service is seriously lacking at this outlet. Joined this outlet more than a year ago, have no issues with the staff or whatsoever. Just that some PT can be very rude to us at times but not that we cannot tolerate. The other day there was a guy using the female toilet at the gym around 11pm, informed the gym about this incident as it’s honestly very unsafe for female users of the gym if this continues. However, I did not even get a reply from the staff, just a blue tick. Even if you do not bother, at least if you have basic manners, perhaps just a PR reply will do. But I guess nobody cares about whether you’re safe or not as long as you’re paying for your membership fees. Seriously contemplating switching to Pasir Panjang gym, the customer service is wonderful and they make every gym user feel valued despite us not paying any fees to them.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyN19qd25RRRAB
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Will,3,"Soap dispenser in female toilet is always malfunctioning. At least for a year.

No square towel tissue and full of hair on toilet counter that's with the sink and hairdryer.

Wifi speed from initial starting very good to lousy. Worse than 3g speed. Today 6mbps considered fast.

5g only for admin and I wonder what do they need such high speed when members are experiencing such low speed.

Told trainer before, no use. Still v slow. Network is so slow that page is always spinning.

Machines breaking down. Repair is slow. Place is also very stuffy. Like saving on aircon.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUbjdQTFBREAE

Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Julian Ang,4,"Large gym space but cramped free weights area. Has 50kg dumbbells which are awesome. Counted 3 racks which is also awesome. Change rooms have showers but they really could be a lot brighter. New Precor treadmills, ellipticals and bikes. Generally empty before 0930/1000 hrs so that's great and there's AC by about 0800hrs (I think).

Overall, it's a nice, large space with a mainly expatriate clientele that's not quite your gym nut, so expect a bit more machine/bench hogging. I'd go again but defo not during slightly busier periods.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURpNWJyWi1BRRAB

Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,J,4,"The Three Musketeers. Harry, Ron & Hermione. Nirvana. Great things come in trios. And that's what keeping this place from being great, as the third squat rack here doesn't have a bar for some reason. It would be great to have more bars overall, as the two mats for dead-lifting/rows are also empty.

Other than that, everything looks great.

EDIT: There are now three power racks each with bars plus a smith machine, thanks!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURzd09HVFRBEAE
Anytime Fitness West Coast Plaza,Roy Lim,5,"Relative 5 stars just because it trumps the Clementi outlet by a mile. It is much larger in size and has many more options to work out the legs, which is half the reason why we are there.
