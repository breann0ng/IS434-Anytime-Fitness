Anytime Fitness Bishan,Justin Hoyo,4,"Very very nice AF (I would say top 5 in Singapore)! Location is rather convenient, only a 3 minute walk form Bishan MRT station. The gym is big and very well-equipped, with dumbbells up to 50KG.

They also have 4 power racks, 1 smith machine, and 2 deadlift platforms! Treadmills were sufficient + 1x stairmaster. Toilets/changing room were also nice and clean ☺️",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VOU1U5TmpwN2R2bFN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Bishan,Sihan Goi,4,"Went for a lunchtime workout on a Monday. Reached around 11 and it was quite crowded. Strangely, the crowd dissipated after a while.

Gym is quite new and has quite an extensive array of Hammer Strength and Lifefitness equipment. 4 racks (2 half and 2 cages), 2 platforms with 2 sets of bumper plates plus 2 extra pairs of 20s. 1 hybrid bar (both PL/WL knurlings) per rack/platform, and there are several metal 2.5kg collars, which are very rare in globogyms, though not very necessary outside of competition.

Not much to complain about if you're a regular gymrat or even powerlifter. However, as a weightlifter, I'd have to say that the bars are sub par. They look OK at first glance, but most of them don't spin properly. I found 2 that aren't stuck, but even then they aren't smooth. That's my biggest gripe and the main reason why it's not 5 stars. Also, the racks are setup very near one another so it's difficult to change plates because the bars are so close to one another. Lastly, the racks have very wide intervals between the hooks, so if you're unlucky, you may not find a good position.  There are also no specialty bars such as trap bars or football/Swiss bars, but that's a minor grievance.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3bjhxYmVREAE
Anytime Fitness Bishan,Angela Tan,5,"Love this gym as it is convenient to travel to from my place and it’s fairly huge. Having a fantastic experience training with one of the PTs here (Yuz). Been training with him for almost a year and have definitely seen noticeable progress. He’s really friendly and knowledgeable. Sessions with him are challenging but am always looking forward to them. Anyone looking for a PT, would highly recommend!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pCNlVtOXBZVjk2TWpSdWJWaEpRVGgxVTBVemFsRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bishan,Abdul Azeem Mustakin,5,"My current favorite gym! It has some of the best facilities—top-notch equipment, plenty of space, and everything you need for an effective workout.

Special shoutout to Yuz! If you're looking for an intense, fat-burning session, I dare you to try his Muay Thai personal training. Guaranteed to torch belly fat—some clients see results in as few as 4 out of 10 sessions! Yuz tailors each workout to your fitness level, pushing you just enough to maximize endurance without overdoing it.

Highly recommend if you want serious results! 💪🔥",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t3d1pEbFRaRmc1Y2t0cU0zSjFiRVJFWjNwVlgxRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bishan,Gerald Yip,3,"Bit crowded so had to wait for machines and weights. Place is quite dusty. Fans blowing out streams of dust. But otherwise a new gym so equipment still good.

*updated om 29th Oct 2024.
Gym fans are now cleaner but the quality of the wiping towels is now worse. Also, although there are many disinfectant dispensers around, only one is working. Some used to be empty but I thought it would be replaced or replenished but it's gotten worse",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3NDlhRk5nEAE
Anytime Fitness Bishan,gisele,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Highly Recommend!

I’ve been training with Mr Hazril, fitness trainer with AF for just a few weeks, and I’m already noticing positive changes in my body’s ability and shape. His knowledge and professionalism are evident in every session. He ensures my safety with the gym equipment and closely monitors how my body adapts to the training. I feel confident and motivated under his guidance, and I’m excited to continue this journey with him. If you’re looking for a trainer who genuinely cares about your progress and well-being, Mr. Hazril is the one to go with!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ3dk9DTzdRRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bishan,Gladys Seah,3,"One of the newer, cleaner AF gyms with a female only shower  & toilet. But I nicked my finger and the staff member on site didn’t know where the first aid kid was kept
& couldn’t even give me a band aid . This was at noon. Makes me shudder to think what would happen if a more serious injury were to occur since staff haven’t even been briefed on where the first aid kit is 😬",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfc28zVHRRRRAB
Anytime Fitness Bishan,a,5,"Two months back, I had the pleasure of working with Hazril , and the experience has been transformative. From our first session, it was clear that he genuinely cares about my goals and well-being. Hazril tailored a program that challenged me while still being achievable, keeping me motivated throughout our sessions.

What I appreciated most was his expertise in form and technique, which not only improved my performance but also helped prevent injuries. Hazril created a supportive and encouraging environment, pushing me to exceed my limits while celebrating my progress.

Thanks to his guidance, I've gained strength, confidence, and a deeper understanding of fitness.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYdHBEbjBnRRAB

Anytime Fitness Bishan,Foo Hui chun,5,"Best anytime fitness i’ve ever been to, with a great range of equipments that i cant find in other branches! Not forgetting my amazing PT trainer Hazril who is extremely knowledgeable and is soooo on point with correcting my form! Often i dont even know what im doing wrong when something feels wrong but without having to say a thing, he notices and corrects and everything just feels so much better! The tips he gives also help me alot and i feel myself improving so much. When i injured my back, he also taught me how to use a massage ball and ensured the muscles and tension on my back is softened/well warmed up before we start any workout. Nutrition wise-he is always there to advise me on my meal plans and is always so encouraging. Cant wait to hit my fitness goals in the coming weeks/months of training with Haz! ☺️",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3bk5hNkFREAE
