Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Joshua Ong,1,"Beware of absurd credit card fees if your payment fails. Was charged $15.26 due to a failed payment on my card because it was expired.

1. Anytime Fitness & Ezypay (their merchant processor) stores the expiry date of cards on file - Even so they still attempt to bill customers KNOWLY that the card is expired so they can earn the money on the “failed payment fee”. I spoke to the Ezypay staff and they claim “they won’t know the card is expired until they try to bill the card.” Which is some BS reason. They HAVE the expiry date of card on file and they can easily setup email reminders for customers to update their payment method. Both AF & EzyPay have the CC expiry date on file and don’t bother to have automated emails to remind members to update the CC on file.

2. They claim is our responsibility to ensure the payment method is valid. Who in the right mind can recall all the cards and expiry dates? Do you recall the expiry date of the last item you bought from the grocery store? Obviously no.

3. I’ve been a paying member of AF for over 3 years. And they don’t give a damn and refuse to waive the failed payment fee which they knowingly charge. Beware of their unethical practices. Feel free to file a complaint with CASE..",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tOR2VrVkhibXcyVGtoSU5GRmhWVjlYZDFwbVZrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Cheryl T,5,"Yew tee AF gym may be small, but it has all the necessary equipment for my workouts (Do hope there are more equipments variety though). It's clean, and the machines are well-maintained, although the air conditioning could use regular servicing.

The manager and staff are incredibly friendly, always greeting members with a smile and engaging in conversation, which creates a welcoming, home-like atmosphere. They're also very helpful, offering fitness advice and demonstrating how to use unfamiliar equipment. This support has made my gym experience much more enjoyable and has given me the confidence to try new exercises.

The other gym-goers are just as friendly, often helping me improve my form, teaching new exercises, and even training with me. This sense of community makes the gym experience fun, and I always look forward to going 😚.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIenFlOWx3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Yen Toh,1,"Visited anytime fitness a year ago. Equipment and weights are fairly enough. Just visited the gym again last week. Utterly disappointed. Weight all over the place. Missing free weight not replaced. Poorly arranged equipment station
Looks as if there is no manager running that gym.
I lived in Melbourne, and I have been with anytime fitness past 3 years for only one reason... that I can use anytime fitness gym facilities overseas. Having to see this kind of gym standard and maintenance, I am quite sure I will terminate my gym membership definitely after this.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR2c28yNy1nRRAB

Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Rohini Ravindran,5,"I've been a member at Anytime Fitness Yew Tee for 3 years, and it's been an amazing fitness journey.

One of the standout features of Yew Tee Anytime Fitness is their exceptional management team. They are attentive, responsive, and truly care about the members' experience. Any concerns or suggestions are swiftly addressed, creating a sense of trust and transparency.

The gym's atmosphere is motivating and inclusive. It's not just a place to work out; it's a place where you can connect with like-minded individuals who share your passion for health and fitness. The camaraderie among members here is something I haven't experienced in other gyms.

Highly recommended!",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNabnBYYjZ3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Marina Phi,5,"Been gyming at this place for the last 3 years. I wouldn't have given a 5 stars rating if it weren't for the staff. They are the best. They really work hard to keep the members happy. Frankly, most of the equipments sucks. Aircon is faulty for so many bloody months but nothing has been done. So for the staffs! 5 Stars. CLUB 1 STAR.  If there's a 0. I would have given it.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIaHJXTjV3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Fernando C,4,"Decent gym. Its not big, but got all the things I need for a good training variation. Good air circulation as well (for me sometimes it is too cold inside even).

The only nitpick is that I hope there are more adjustable benches in front of the dumbell rack. Usually there's only one, and in some scenario that one bench is taken away somewhere else 🥲",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM3cjZiemRBEAE

Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Saraswathi Subramanian,1,"Be careful when you sign up with this gym - Anytime Fitness Yew Tee.
They will not inform you that your membership has ended and will continue to charge on your card. When you find out, the management will ignore your emails and drag more than 2 weeks just to acknowledge. I also have 1 free month after my 12th month membership but they ignored that and continued to charge my 13th month. When I asked about it, they claimed that refund cannot be done and that i can use the 14th month for free. This is really ridiculous and cheating.
The gym overall is clean and well maintained but the services there sucks.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwaktxQkZ3EAE

The gym goers here likes to hog the equipments. The staff needs to look into this.

Place getting really crowded. Its small area, made it worst. Exercise bike kaput went unrepaired for more than two months.

Feedbacks given fell on deaf ears.

Better off signing on with other brands that manage their gyms better.

Don't waste your money here.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJeTZLQ0tnEAE
Anytime Fitness Yew Tee Community Club,Ohw wen,1,Really small space and claustrophobic. Only 1 squat rack which is use for squats and benchpress. Lots of hoggers. Groups will hog the squat rack for more than an hour and are unfriendly to others. Equipment are not well maintained and repairs take a few weeks. Music is overly loud.

They brought up contract and saying that they have freeze my accounts for 5 months and i am not able to cancel. So i told them i have surgery and not able to gym.
