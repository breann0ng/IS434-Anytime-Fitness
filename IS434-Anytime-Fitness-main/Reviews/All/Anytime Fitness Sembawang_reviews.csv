Anytime Fitness Sembawang,Selva,5,"Hands down, the best choice I’ve made is chose to get trained at Anytime Fitness Sembawang. Very friendly team especially Jordan who inspired me to undergo training. I look forward to walk through the doors and always feel amazing when I leave.

My experience with the Gym has been tremendous and I continue to keep up. Convenience at its finest. A special shout out to my personal trainer(PT) Kaden who has been always very much kind and generous.
When I started my training, I was around 86.2kg now reduced to 78kg in just a span of 1 month. Since I started working with him (Kade-PT),I’m amazed by the results, and very grateful for his help.

I’ve never been more proud to look at me “before” vs ""now"". Thank you for helping me come this far, your personal approach has worked wonders for me.

Anytime Fitness Sembawang,Mia PGB,5,"My husband and I were gaining weight and we had no excuse. It was the health issues we were experiencing that prompted us to go on a fitness plan. Anytime Fitness Sembawang and their personal trainer Nina helped us a lot in getting the results we wanted.

The gym is well equipped and ventilated. All the staff, from the managers, trainers and maintenance are super friendly, approachable, and very supportive from day one. The gym itself and the equipment are really clean, which we greatly appreciated. I was never uncomfortable whenever I was there. The gym being a stone's throw away from our work place was also a plus.

Nina is an amazing trainer. I am grateful for her patience, support and encouragement. She has set a regime for us to follow that worked very well. We were able to get to our fitness goals with hard work, dedication and determination not only by me and my husband but with Nina as well. She was with us althroughout and has been a huge part of us being healthy. We only have fond memories of you, Nina!

The benefit of being with Anytime Fitness is that you can use any of their gyms as long as you have your fob with you. We lived in Ang Mo Kio and it was never troublesome for us to visit AF's other branches during our off days and away from Sembawang. This is applicable internationally, too.

Unfortunately, we had to say goodbye to this amazing gym because we migrated to Australia in January this year. Although our journey with  Anytime Fitness Sembawang was short, it was definitely a fruitful and enjoyable experience. We are planning to sign up with AF near our place soon.

Thank you for the wonderful experience, AF Sembawang! We are missing this awesome gym a lot! 💪

Regards to everyone!

When I saw that the Sembawang branch was starting, it also prompted me to try it out and since then, I've stuck to it for years and counting.

One of the main reasons for my decision are because of the friendly atmosphere I got when in the gym. The management and all their staff members are so friendly and very helpful to everyone; and I believe this is the reason why it's such a friendly and family oriented branch.  And this friendly approach rubs on to everyone in the gym thus most members do get to know each other very fast. Have made many friends of similar interest here.

The equipments for all muscle groups are sufficiently available and most importantly is that they are well maintained and any faulty parts are replaced very quickly. There are also alot of classes in the gym to choose from, regardless whether you're a beginner or an advanced gym goer.

Kudos to the Sembawang Anytime Fitness management and staff of the  for being able to create such a great  ambiance to workout in.

Keep it up guys! 💪",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURrcTZiSmN3EAE
Anytime Fitness Sembawang,Akhil,1,"Title: Terrible Experience - Avoid Anytime Fitness at All Costs!

I recently had the most disappointing and frustrating experience with Anytime Fitness, and I feel compelled to share it with others to prevent them from going through the same ordeal. Before joining the gym, they recommended that I take a 1.5-year membership without mentioning the existence of a notice period. They also assured me that they would assist in holding my membership during periods when I needed to be away from Singapore. Unfortunately, the reality turned out to be far from what was promised.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I lost my job and had to return to India. As requested by Anytime Fitness, I provided them with all the required documentation, including a one way air ticket, a photo of my passport seal upon entering India, and a screenshot of my location on Google Maps. Despite complying with their demands, after the third month, they suddenly informed me that they couldn't extend my membership any further and resumed charging me.

To make matters worse, my membership had already expired six months ago, well beyond the initially agreed 1.5-year duration. When I requested to cancel my membership, they insisted on an additional paid month as a notice period, even though my financial situation was dire due to the lack of job opportunities and the high cost of living in Singapore. I explained my predicament, but they callously charged me twice, a total of $31, claiming that the cancellation couldn't be processed.

Aside from the horrendous customer service, the gym itself is far from satisfactory. The lack of sufficient equipment and the overwhelming number of people make it nearly impossible to have a productive workout, especially during peak hours. I strongly advise anyone looking for a gym in the Nordcomm or Gymbox area to consider alternative options, as the experience at Anytime Fitness is simply not worth the trouble.

Save yourself the frustration, disappointment, and unnecessary expenses by avoiding Anytime Fitness at all costs. There are definitely better gyms in the area that offer superior customer service and a more conducive workout environment.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKXzVMV0tnEAE

After weeks of notifying staff that the airconditioning is off after midnight, making the conditions of those who train during those hours very unsatisfying, nothing has changed. Occasionally even see trainers come in at 7am and notice that the airconditioned has been turned off the whole time and just giggle. Not sure how difficult it is to keep the AC on after midnight or at least notify people that it will be kept off. So far just empty assurances. Not recommended at all for anyone planning to train after midnight, inconsistent and poorly managed. Staff will give you a hard time if you squat without shoes in the power rack, but not do anything about anyone who doesnt rerack their weight or use towels.
