Only AF in SG with a pool - Hotel pool in fact. With towels too. Work out here for a hotel gym-swim-chill session. Shower 🚿 is one of the best among AF. Rack is old though. Not too many machines and only one or two rack for free weight. Suffice though. Quiet too that's the bonus for people who wants tranquility. Expat crowd.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25kaFVsTkVWRmMzVDBFNVFuVlJkRFJ6TFhGVGVuYxAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Alexander Aaltonen,3,"I was around the area and needed a place for a workout, so decided to try this AF outlet. Overall a decent gym, super clean and we'll maintained equipment. But in terms of size, it's definitely quite small and not too much variety in equipment. Good enough for the essentials! A big plus with this outlet is that you also get access to the pool and you can also catch the shuttle bus that operates here.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWSVpGQklhWFZRUjBWdmQwODBRMGhwU1dwU1dXYxAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Jeremy Lim,5,"Gym itself is small but functional. Main issue is only one squat rack but it that said, it also has a platform. Dumbbells up to 30kg. The definite big feature is the fact that they give you access to the lap pool. 6am-10pm. Just have to come and tap. Awesome.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2pOMldIWjZZMGt0U1haTlF6QnpiWGhxWDNFd1RIYxAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Emy Yue,5,"“Anytime Fitness Balmoral” has quickly become one of my favorite places to work out. The environment is welcoming, clean, and motivating—perfect for anyone at any fitness level. The gym is well-equipped, and I love that it’s spacious enough to never feel overcrowded.

One of the highlights for me is the swimming pool, which is always well-maintained and a refreshing way to mix up my workouts. On top of that, the pickleball court is such a fun addition—it’s a great way to stay active while enjoying a more social and energetic atmosphere.

What makes the experience even better is the professionalism and support from the trainers, especially Trainer Riffic. He is knowledgeable, encouraging, and knows how to create a workout plan that suits my goals. His energy and guidance make every session productive and enjoyable.

Overall, Anytime Fitness Balmoral offers not just a gym, but a complete lifestyle environment—with excellent facilities, a positive vibe, and trainers like Raffiq who truly care.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21OaFpVeG9RbVJTT1dsaU9VcENjSEZpYjBwa2JHYxAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Talia Wong,5,"Clean, sufficient equipment, friendly staff (thanks Seri!). Dumbbell up to 30kg. Doesn’t feel like a gym with the pool and courts access. All gyms should be equipped like this, tie up w hotel 😂 …",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2tseE1FdHdlVGcwV0ROSE9XZGlNRFoyTFVwbFlrRRAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Justin Hoyo,3,"Cozy gym located at Mercury Hotel Stevens. Equipment were new and well-maintained, but I would consider this more of an “hotel” gym as it was very small, the weights were quite limited, and there were very few machines as well. Hotel guests (non-af members) could also access and use the gym - which I find quite strange.

One plus point is that af members can use the swimming pool! There is also a pickleball court, but it’s extremely expensive at $45 per hour during peak hours (af members can get $5 off).",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VLbVU1SW0teHRDZlpBEAE
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Jesslyn Ho,5,The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff is very friendly!

Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Giovanni el gato,5,"It’s a gym , honestly filled with really great people , Rafiq was very approachable and he greets the guest when they enters and always ask how we are doing
syah is a great trainer too , even tough he’s not my trainer , there was once i wasn’t so sure about an exercise but he was really nice and taught me how to do it properly.
Seri was also really nice when i first entered she gave me a full run down o. how it works around the gym works and what facilities there are and what we can do here , really clear on the instructions on how the membership works too
overall , here has whatever you need to work on , there is a room where it’s empty but with weights and super great for abs and cardio really love the vibes and people and will always come back :))",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2psNFlXcEpMVVozT0Znd1puUkRha2h5VjNCaWMyYxAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Tabasco Guzzler,5,"I used to be a member of the old Pinetree Club - so it was nostalgic to step into the building after many years of not being there. The place has changed completely - but the AF workout areas are super clean, with loos that are spic & span, as it's a fairly new gym. Very friendly staff who are proactive and provide great tips if you need help. AF members get free access to the decent lap pool & discounts on pickleball court bookings. Possibly the only AF gym that provides access to a pool!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25WblYzTXdOa05QTmt0dFYzWk1hMjk2YVRKelFWRRAB

Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Shaun H,5,"I had the privilege to work with Alan for >1 year. He's truly someone who's passionate about leading a healthy lifestyle. Essentially, he's dedicated, professional and easy going. He has motivated me to return to the gym and lead a healthy lifestyle.  His gentle yet concise pointers have refined my technique and I've already seen significant gains in the last 1 year. He backs all his nutritional & workout advice from academic journals & with his advice I'm in better shape in my 30s than I was in my 20s. Thanks for helping me achieve my physical and mental goals and being able to be the feel like a new person. Till our next fitness challenge. -Dr Shaun Ho",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT214d2RHRk1lVFZWZUhoMWEyRlpjR2gzYnpoMVRtYxAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Lim Shiqing,5,"Started going to this gym a few months ago and I’m loving it! The environment is great — clean, well-maintained space with new machines and helpful, friendly staff.

A big shoutout to my personal trainer, Alan. He’s super patient and really understands what women need from a fitness program. I’ve always hated squats, and while most trainers say there’s no way around them, Alan introduced effective alternatives that still get results. He tailors every session so I feel challenged, but never overwhelmed.

Highly recommend Alan, especially for female clients looking for a supportive and thoughtful trainer!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKTmNucDZUUzFZZVZWVlZXRkNMVmxDY0ZCRmJGRRAB
Anytime Fitness Balmoral,jt wong,5,"I’ve been a member of this gym since April, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience! Although the space isn’t massive, it’s well-equipped with everything you need for a solid workout. The gym is always clean and well-maintained,  organized, creating a comfortable environment.

What truly sets this place apart is the friendly and helpful staff — , a shout out to Seri ( extremely nice lady) , they’re always welcoming and ready to assist. This is also the only AF gym I know of that comes with an attached swimming pool with shower facilities, which is such a big plus. On top of that, they even have a pickleball court, which adds a fun and unique touch to the overall experience.

Highly recommend this gym to anyone looking for a complete, convenient, and enjoyable fitness experience!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xKNVYzbDRRMVZ5YTJKdFVTMVhVRlZ2WjE5WlJFRRAB

Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Yiming Li,1,"I wanted to be transferred out of this gym and i stopped going there. But i was manually signed in on the 26th of October. I strongly suspect this is the gym's doing to not lose members as the sign in resetted the time to transfer out. Thats rather scummy i aint gonna lie. In my humble opinion, i feel like the loss of their members is due to their imcompetence.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT20xNFkxUnhhSFJxV25Cck1GOXdkamRzU1c5WllXYxAB

Anytime Fitness Balmoral,Li Ru Lim,5,"If you’re looking for a personal trainer who not only knows their stuff but truly cares, look no further. Allan is the kind of person who makes every session feel less like a workout and more like a boost of joy and motivation.

From day one, he went the extra mile—always checking in, adjusting the program based on how I felt, and celebrating even the smallest wins with genuine excitement. What really sets Allan apart is his infectious energy. Like a ray of sunshine, he brightens up even the toughest mornings, and somehow makes pushing limits actually fun.

Training with Allan isn’t just about fitness—it’s about feeling supported, uplifted, and inspired. I honestly couldn’t ask for a better coach or companion on this journey.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2s5U1oxcGpjVTFPTmpkaFdYZHdTbVJaZVVSRlduYxAB

Alan is a rare blend of professionalism, expertise, and genuine encouragement. From day one, he took the time to understand my goals and tailored each session to challenge and motivate me without overwhelming.
His attention to form, technique, and progress is unmatched, and he consistently finds ways to keep workouts fresh and engaging. What truly sets Alan apart is his ability to create a supportive environment—he’s not just a trainer, he’s a cheerleader, coach, and mentor all rolled into one.
Thanks to Alan, I’ve seen real results and gained confidence both inside and outside the gym. If you're looking for someone who truly cares and brings out the best in you, Alan’s your guy!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xBdFIzZEtaVGx3WW1ORWVWSndWRFZxVm5ocVVsRRAB
