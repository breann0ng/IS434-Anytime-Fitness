Anytime Fitness Labrador View,Jehna Malinis,5,"This branch is much bigger than the usual Anytime Fitness gyms I’ve been to, very spacious with plenty of room to work out comfortably. All the equipment is brand new, and even the small details like having brand new hairdryers are a plus. The views from the gym make workouts more enjoyable, and the staff are really kind and welcoming. Great place to train!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21oQlJWcFpaVTAxZEdGd1p5MXZTMlkzTFhZdE9HYxAB
Anytime Fitness Labrador View,Karen Kay Matias,5,"Great location with a view of the harboufront sunset!!

Space is not very crowded, always clean and complete with all the equipments I need!
Shower is perfect for those heading office after workout!

Very friendly and accommodating staffs!
Gigi has been very helpful in assisting me from the moment I signed up to sending me regular updates . She even went extra mile in assisting me and my friends who are doing free trial!

10/10 worth the gym fees!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t4TU1IZzFVbDlaVURRMVlUUlFlVTVmVHpoV2RXYxAB
Anytime Fitness Labrador View,Mitcher Pang,5,"I can't recommend Anytime Fitness Labrador View enough. This gym truly stands out for two major reasons: the top-notch equipment and the incredible view.

The gym is always clean, well-maintained, and stocked with a fantastic range of modern equipment. Whether you're into cardio, strength training, or functional fitness, they have everything you need. The machines are from great brands and are consistently in working order, which makes every workout session smooth and effective.

But the real game-changer is the view! Working out while looking out over the water and the Labrador area is incredibly motivating. It turns a routine session into a genuinely enjoyable experience. It’s the perfect way to clear your head and energize your body.

The staff are also very friendly and professional, and the 24/7 access is the ultimate convenience. If you're looking for a gym that will make you want to work out, this is the place.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT25saFFuY3lNbE0yVFc1R1oySlphM1prVVdaV2IxRRAB
Anytime Fitness Labrador View,Derrick Tay,4,"Nice decent size and new solid equipment! Also friendly and helpful staff!
However, air circulation is bad and temperature is too warm. The fans and air circulators is just not cooling the place like a proper airconditioner. There are many ceiling cassette aircon but only 1 is switched on.  Please improve on your air conditioning! Much appreciated!",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2poTFZWaEJia3BrZGkwelNXNXJNMkpyTlVaUFEzYxAB
