Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,Jake Lo,5,"Absolutely worth signing up to this location especially after the renovations. Comfortable, well-spaced out, and plenty of properly-maintained equipment.
There are also 2 vending machines offering a good variety of options. The gym also has a Dyson hairdryer for quick post-shower drying.
The location being in Loyang Point also means easy access to food, 2 supermarkets, and a 7-11.
At time of signup, the staff were also professional and very welcoming.",,Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2taNGEwdHFXR1prYkVJelRWcFRlbVZwYkVkYVQyYxAB

Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,Yvonne Yeo 3003,5,"Dear QIF,

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation for the excellent guidance and support you provided during my very first personal training session on 21st April 2025 at Loyang Point.

Your professionalism, patience, and encouragement made a strong impression on me. You took the time to understand my fitness goals, assess my current condition, and explain each exercise clearly. I felt both motivated and comfortable throughout the session — something that really matters to someone just starting out.

Your positive energy and enthusiasm are contagious, and I’m genuinely looking forward to our next sessions. Thank you for making this first step into my fitness journey such a positive and empowering experience.

Keep up the amazing work!

Warm regards,
Yvonne",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvdEpuZlRREAE
Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,syahril54,5,"Loyang point is a very spacious and welcoming gym especially for beginners.

But to maximise the setup and space, could the area with the platform and racks be reorganised for more structured placement of weight plates and safer positioning of the racks?",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VOdWJyWWFYa056cTdnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,Hey Matthew,5,"I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the team at Anytime Fitness Loyang Point. After suffering an elbow fracture and ligament tear in January, I was unable to exercise for months.

Today, when I approached the team about resuming my membership to regain strength through light workouts (as advised by my physiotherapist), they were incredibly understanding and supportive.

They patiently explained the necessary procedures without hesitation and even went the extra mile by waiving my pro-rated payment for the month. They also gave me the option to freeze my membership if needed, demonstrating not just professionalism but genuine care for their members' well-being.

Such dedication and customer service are truly commendable. A big shoutout to the team at Anytime Fitness Loyang Point, for creating such a supportive and caring environment!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNRNl9hMkhnEAE
Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,David,5,"Edit: Thank you for your response! That makes sense! Looking forward to more! And I think the renovation is dope and still love the staff and their effort to make the place hospitable!

Previous: Omg as much as I love yall. The new machines yall just bought are so bad...its such a waste of money and space. Please I support yall wholeheartedly, put your money and space to good use, cus this is just waste of investment my brain cant function why yall would buy such machines :'( HAHAHAHA",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3NVo3aTlnRRAB
Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,SiewNing Loh,1,"I reported that a treadmill was not functioning well, the touch screen is not working. The staff on duty responded by saying “ if you want to use this machine, you got to pull out the emergency plug”. No sign to indicate the “adaptive function” to users. Less than 10 minutes later, another member stepped on it and the machine sped up to 10km/h just as it did when I used it.  Safety isn’t a concern for this gym.
To management, many members are very unhappy with your staff. It is only a matter of time that this gym will suffer the damages they are causing.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYeUpMVFF3EAE
Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,Daniel Loh,1,"Yes, I had a bad experienced too. Was in the gym the previous weekend and there weee three staff at the counter. Told them politely that the heavy rock music was too loud and too heavy going for a gym. It was stressful to say the least. There was screaming one the vocals. Just unbearable. The staff looked at each other and smiled and nodded. I walked away and realised there was no change and nothing was done to change the music or to tone down the volume. Really poor service and disregard for members feedback. Hope something can be done. Not the first time I have given wrt the music choice in the gym. Got better for a weeks after the last feedback but it’s back to heavy metal soon after. Wish the management can look into the quality of staff and management of the gym.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYeU52eVBnEAE

Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,Eddie Noah,1,"Hi,I hope this message finds you well. I hate to be the one doing all these complaining.Im expressing my ongoing concern regarding the lack of music at the gym. There were previous complaints about this issue, and while it was temporarily resolved, the music has once again been turned off.

If there is a technical problem, I kindly request that it be addressed promptly. While bringing our own headphones is an option, it should not be considered a solution to this recurring issue. Members should not have to compensate for the gym's inability to maintain a basic amenity.

It feels as though our complaints are not being taken seriously. If this matter is not resolved soon, I will have no choice but to escalate it to higher management, as it reflects poorly on the overall management of the gym.

It is important to remember that while membership payments are crucial, providing a satisfactory experience for gym members should be a priority. I hope to see a swift resolution to this issue.

Also,as a manager of the gym,it is very unprofessional to call the gym members for help  whenever there’s ANY technical issues with the gym.

As of today,there are still NO music provided.
Otherwise,sometimes the  same song played over and over for hours.Worse,the yoga sessions music from last night were not switched off and it sounds like the gym is at Mandai Crematorium music.
Please look into this matter as the manager in charge here is totally unreliable and incompetent.

Thank you",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNyd0lhQ2t3RRAB
Anytime Fitness Loyang Point,Shayuslyn Sharif,5,"Really glad that I signed up as a member here! Convenient location, good variety of equipment and huge workout space. Gym members are easy-going and accommodating too. Special thanks to my personal trainer, Gabriel for helping me out with strength-training and nutrition. Really happy with my progress so far, managed to lose some weight and gain muscle mass. Workouts are far from boring, Gabriel throws in a good mix of exercises and keeps the sessions fresh. I also enjoy meal prepping now, and I'm quite sure that these basics are going to serve me well in the years to come. I'd highly recommend Gabriel if you're looking for a personal trainer. 💯

Keep up the great work, AF Loyang Point!",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKNk5uREV3EAE

Perhaps the best thing about this gym is its ambience. The gym gets plenty of sunlight and isn’t infested by the ugly purple, which makes it so much easier to go one more.",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNaLVBYU2lRRRAB
