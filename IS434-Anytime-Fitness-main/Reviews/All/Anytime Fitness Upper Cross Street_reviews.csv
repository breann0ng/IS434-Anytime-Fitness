Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Lester Teo,5,"AF Upper Cross St recently completed renovations and need to do justice to the previous poor reviews. Updated gym flooring, machines, free weights, no suspicious smells, spacious training area on L2, but most impressed at the spanking new showers with wet/dry areas and vanity section. Well done by the management! But my favourite outlet is still AF Orchard cause of the Dyson hairdryer.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKaDR1UExREAE

Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Alexander Yip,1,"Would be a 0 star if not because of the minimum, but hey! If you guys considering of sign up for gym, dont sign up anytime fitness because the staff will not be responsible to help you, they will push to each other and eventually become the member's fault.

Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Vin,5,"The gym is a short 5-minute walk away from Chinatown MRT.

The gym spans two floors. The first floor houses most of the equipment, and the second is largely a CrossFit area with 7 individual shower rooms (3 male, 2 female and 2 unisex). From the well-worn interior, it's apparent that the outlet is old.

Unlike most other Anytime Fitness outlets, the music selection here is tasteful and should satisfy the average gym patron. There are also lockers that are free to use.

My only gripe about this outlet is that the shower room doesn't have a stool of sorts so that patrons can put their belongings while showering. We'd have to hang out bags from hooks behind the door.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNJbzdDQU93EAE
Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Zavier Teo,1,"Terrible management, will force a predatory 15% upcharge of monthly fees if there are any issues with their payment provider. Seems like they enjoy gouging their loyal customers for their own financial benefit.

Equipments here are barely maintained, most seats show signs of wear and falling apart equipment is the norm here.

Have seen plenty of cockroaches roaming around the gym.

Recently ""upgraded"" but no upkeep is done, toilets are filthy, smelly and disgusting. Sink area is constantly covered in hair. Toilet seats covered in urine. No ventilation in the cubicles as well.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VKdUUzSkdYaXVINlFnEAE

Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,J L,2,"Just an okay gym convenient for post-work hours gym sessions. 2nd floor is poorly utilised with racks but no proper padding and enough plates which could have been used for more types of lifting other than squats. So most people are just on the 2nd floor for random core workouts.
Biggest flaw of the gym is the lack of enforcement by staff to tell people to put back their weights. Lots of ignorant and inconsiderate gym goers here but well what can you do; it’s either this or Cecil st gym. Would go somewhere if I could",,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUR3cl9Ec25nRRAB
Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Alex D,1,"I won’t dwell on the negative reviews about the moldy toilets since that’s been covered enough already.

As a long-time member visiting this branch for the first time, I actually had to stop my workout halfway through and head to another branch just to finish it. The way this gym is set up is really strange compared to others.

Like many have said, the second floor is empty, and all the foot traffic is on the first floor. Yet the only water dispenser is on the second floor.

There are three power racks but only one bench available.

In the dumbbell area, there’s only one adjustable bench, while the rest are flat benches, which would’ve made more sense in the power rack area.

Lastly, the cable pulley section doesn’t even have a rope handle. There are four pulley machines, but the most commonly used attachments are missing. The other AF branches have plenty of them.

It’s as if the gym manager doesn’t even work out and has no clue how things should function.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURuZ3E2TUtBEAE

Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Sienna V,1,"oh my God the state of the toilets. Black mould everywhere! Poor drainage literally 0 venilation, for some reason there are 2 doors within a tiny shower.

Can management remove some panelling and allow the water to evaporate? The current state of the showers is like a steam room, and I bet it's a bacteria breeding ground. Health hazard.

Despite it being newly renovated, the toilets were just an afterthought. This AF is run by RFT group, so they have hairdryers from 1980s just like their yishun & nex branch.

4 sets of very old hairdryers instead of 1 higher model hairdryers. Also, one of the old dryers is broken.

Those who have sinus or sensitive nose issues, you may avoid because the carpet flooring is poorly maintained. The cleanliness was not well maintained as equipment was not properly clean and you still can see sweat marks on the equipments. People hogging the equipment and sometimes multiple equipment at one time. This make the experience terrible.

The toilet has a strong sewage pungent and condition is comparable to a public toilet. Not sure anyone working at this outlet but it just felt like an outlet left abandoned.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NnBhQ0lnEAE
Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Ms.J Hassim,1,"have been coming to this outlet pre reno and post reno. they did some great things with the toilet and shower yeah no big deal. but one I don’t get is they have this massive (what I’d call it) functional training space at L2.. yes I get it, it’s gym rules to have proper footwear when training, especially when dealing with weights. here’s the thing: some people train barefoot as part of their conditioning. it’s backed by evidence that barefoot training have it’s positive side. previous management are all about supporting their members in their journey. the new people from of current management though, not only they are the only AF staffs that don’t smile to their members, they’re almost like snobs. today i got told off I need to wear shoes when training at L2. Sure, I was only doing some ATG squats, dead hangs, cossacks and i probably weigh 135lbs so perhaps I am a threat to myself /s. I wore my shoes thereafter. No big deal i thought, except it was. For the last 10 times I been there, I’ve been bare footing whilst training not until 19/1/24, right. Soon, came a dude who was in Slippers and the footwear police didn’t come and tell him off to wear his shoes so I reckon it’s more like; If you’re gonna do barefoot, don’t let the staff see you?. In hindsight perhaps they felt it’s their duty to enforce club rules, don’t know. It differs between different staffs too I guess. Since not everyone’s a footwear police. the Guy PT didn’t bat an eye the few times he saw me barefooted? I’ve been to a few other AF branches, old and new and all ran by different groups. all of them smiled and greeted any members that walked in their gym.. Especially the guys not too far from their neighbourhood, AF Bugis. I loved coming to UCS branch cause they had solid racks for people who train functional and bodyweight like me (they have a gymnastics ring which they didn’t dispose off from the previous guys) and that was a plus, big time. they didn’t bother me much with barefooting, even when they did that one time, they were polite. and EXCUSE ME, we’re the paying members of your gym, if you were to reinforce footwear at least do it politely. Now I’m not even planning to come back and hope I tapped in enough at other branch so my membership gets converted to others, anywhere BUT UCS. Good luck maintaining your old members. slowly starting to see less familiar faces in that branch. whilst a gym as small as Queensway shopping still have the familiar faces from pre pandemic.",,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNOXzdhWVNREAE

Not really used to having the key fob (which is charged with $85 and non-refundable even after membership ends) with me yet, so forgot it at home, which is my bad. As I was already at the studio, I went in and thought it’d be okay as I’m a member. Could show ID + my contact. But don’t expect any support from them - trainer Kimberly rushed towards me and kicked me straight out in a very rude manner. Explained the situation but didn’t even listen to me.

Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,YETI_97,2,This gym is a good gym however I noticed something recently that has been bothering me. I stay at CCK but I do frequent this gym as it is in the vicinity of where I work during after office hours at around 7. There is this middle aged Chinese gentleman with a beard(not that I have any issues with his age) wearing singlet and spandex that trains around this timing as well for 3-4 hours. He would pace around the gym with his headphones on and grunt excessively loud as well as obnoxiously slam the weights especially on the lat pulldown machine causing a distraction to other gym members and even frightening some to the point where they feel uncomfortable to train near him and would physically move to the other side of the gym. I understand if he grunts when the weight is heavy but he does it even when the weight is relatively light. He would also pace around the gym and stare at other members giving off a very intimidating vibe. I am astounded that the staff ignores his lack of gym etiquette and I can say this would be a reason for me to not return to the gym. I really hope the staff would give him a verbal warning because I myself have seen other members especially females feel really intimidated by him and I am sure they have lodged a complaint as well. Hope to see some follow up on this because I really like this outlet!,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocjQzc2ZREAE

Anytime Fitness Upper Cross Street,Savannah F,1,"Really dirty. Was charged $25 as a visitors for a gross gym and rude service.  To be charged so much and not have a half decent space to work out is a joke. I’m moving to Singapore and do not recommend you go here as a local or a tourist. Clean your equipment! Disgusting.

Because I can reply to the passive aggressive comment that was just left by a staff member I will leave it here.

If the gym is so clean than why are there 2-3 other RECENT Reviews stating otherwise? One written 5 days before mine? And yes I was at the time a tourist visitor. But this location does not live up to Anytime fitness standards  (which I have been to in MULTIPLE countries) it is  for this reason why I was upset about having to pay the $25. But to be fair I should have walked around the gym before paying. It’s my fault for having faith that the gym would live up to decent hygiene expectations ESPECIALLY IN SINGAPORE. This should be a well maintained gym considering where it’s located and how “new” it is. It’s even more appalling because the gym is new you would expect it to be good quality. Not to mention there is little to no staff member present and the one that was there was abrasive and rude ( also noted in OTHER people’s comments) you guys clearly need to up your standards people have commented saying the bathrooms made them want to puke so my apologies for not going into further details about the disgusting state of the gym.

She replied rudely ""no u have to put it on now!"". I obliged without any hesitation. However, when I was leaving the gym we bumped into one another and I tried to be friendly and said ""bye"" she simply rolled her eyes and walked away. I am not sure having such personal trainer to represent this brand and branch is an ideal move. A gesture like that totally ruined my impression and experience here.
